	I.  Abstract

	Kermit is a program developed at Columbia University for
	communication between computers using asynchronous ASCII
	protocols.   It is designed to be implementable under a
	wide variety of machines and operating systems.

	This document describes some of the features and restrictions
	of Kermit running under the IAS operating system.  The IAS
	version of Kermit is a modification of the RSX-11 version of
	Kermit, but because of differences in the operating systems
	not all of the features of RSX Kermit are currently available
	under IAS Kermit.

	II.  Supported features

	IAS Kermit supports most of the features of RSX Kermit:

	    o	file transfers
	    o	remote and local commands
	    o	spawning installed tasks
	    o	dial-out lines
	    o	extensive help facility

	Some of these features involve procedures not required under
	RSX, because of the restrictions placed by the timesharing
	executive:

	    1)	Dial-out lines must not be interactive terminals.
		That is, if you are going to use a line as a dial-
		out line, you must not allocate it to PDS or SCI.

	    2)	Spawning installed tasks is currently done via a
		SPWN$ directive rather than via RUN$T.  Therefore,
		anyone wanting to spawn installed tasks must have
		the PR.RTC (real-time) privilege.  A workaround is
		to exit from Kermit, run the program, and then
		run Kermit again.  Kermit will first try to run an
		installed task named $$$xxx, where xxx is the system
		command requested;  if that fails, Kermit will try
		to run an installed task named ...xxx.

	    3)	Wild-card file operations are supported (for example,
		DIR *.DAT, DEL *.TSK, SEND *.MAC).  Under RSX, Kermit
		uses RMS version 2 to do wild-card operations;  this
		is available under IAS V3.2 but not under IAS V3.1.
		Therefore, on IAS V3.1 (the version that the EPA is
		running), there are the following restrictions on file
		operations:

		    a)	Wild-cards must be specified for the entire
			field or not at all.  For example, TEST.*
			is OK but TEST*.* is not.

		    b)	If a wild-card file operation is executed,
			with either the file-name or the file-type
			specified as a wild-card, the file version
			number is also taken to be a wild-card.

		    c)	Wild-card operations are not allowed on
			directories.  Therefore, [*,*]*.DAT is not
			a legal wild-card operation in Kermit-IAS.
			It is legal to use explicit directories, such
			as [200,200]*.DAT.

		    d)	RMS Version 2 supports transparent DECNET
			remote file operations, while RMS Version 1
			does not.  Therefore, Kermit-IAS under IAS V3.1
			does not support DECNET file transfers.

		    e)	Renaming files within Kermit is not supported
			under V3.1 of IAS.

	    4)	Kermit under IAS currently reads packets one character
		at a time, and so can use up a fair amount of the CPU
		if it is receiving files.  If it is sending packets
		(sending files or remote command responses), or if it
		is reading commands rather than its file transfer packets,
		it will use long I/O operations and will not put an 
		excessive burden on the system.


	III.  Unsupported Features

	The only major unsupported features are related to the use of
	RMS Version 1 on IAS V3.1.  See the section above on the
	supported RMS features for a discussion of RMS and Kermit.

	IV.  Installation and Required Files

	Kermit is built as a multi-user task, with a task name of
	$$$KER.  It can be run as an installed "foreign command"
	task:

		PDS> install k11ias

		PDS> kermit
		Kermit-11 T2.30
		Kermit-11>...

	You can also specify another name for the installed command:

		PDS> install/sys:k11 k11ias

		PDS> k11
		Kermit-11 T2.30
		Kermit-11>...

	Or you can just run it as a non-installed task:

		PDS> run k11ias
		16:30:15
		Kermit-11 T2.30
		Kermit-11>...

	The following files are supplied for Kermit-IAS to run:

		K11IAS.TSK	- The Kermit task image
		K11HLP.HLP	- The Kermit help file.  For this to
				  be used by Kermit, it must be in the
				  default directory.  Note that it is
				  not necessary to set the PDS default
				  directory since you can also specify
				  a default directory within Kermit.
		K11IAS.DOC	- This file, describing Kermit on IAS
		K11INS.DOC	- Documentation on installation of
				  Kermit
