File specifications.

The general format of a file name is:

  NODE::DEVICE:[DIRECTORY]NAME.TYPE;VERSION

'Node' refers to the  DECNET  node  name,  for  example,  FUBAR::,  if
applicable.   'Device',  if  present, refers to the physical device or
logical name where the file resides.

For RSTS/E, 'device' can be a physical device, such as DB0:  or  DU1:,
or  it  can  be a user or system logical name which may include both a
physical device name and a directory name.  If the device  name  is  a
logical  name,  is  it  composed  of  1  to 9 alphanumeric characters,
including '$', as in DISK$ONE:, LB:  and so on.  For instance, the DCL
system command

  $ ASS/SYS DB1:[200,210] SRC$DIR

would associate both the device DB1:   and  directory  [200,210]  with
SRC$DIR:.   Explicitly  given  directories  override  directory  names
imbedded in a logical name.  Names longer  than  nine  characters  are
truncated by the executive.

In the case of RSX-11M/M+ and RT-11, the device name can be  either  a
physical name, such as DU0:, or a logical name which will translate to
a physical device name, such as LB:.

On  RSTS/E  and  RSX-11M/M+,  the   [directory]   is   a   UIC   (user
identification  code) or PPN (project,programmer) number of the format
[NNN,MMM].  All users are assigned a UIC (or PPN)  when  accounts  are
created,  this is the number you give to LOGIN to log into the system.
It is also your default UIC (or PPN).  Micro-Rsx  and  P/OS  may  have
directories  in  either  UIC format or named directory format, such as
[1,2] or [KERMIT].  For P/OS, the default  directory  is  [USERFILES].
Directories are not used for RT-11.

The NAME field is the primary identifier for the file.  The  name  can
be  one  to  nine  characters  for RSX-11M/M+ and P/OS, and one to six
characters for RSTS/E, RT-11 and TSX+.  The TYPE field is usually used
to  group  files  according  to some convention.  For example, XXX.FTN
refers to a Fortran-77 source file, FOO.C to a 'C'  source  file,  and
K11POS.TSK refers to a task image.

The version field is applicable ONLY to RSX type systems.  The default
version is always the highest version number.

All systems mentioned support some sort of filename  wildcarding,  the
flexibility  of which varies by executive.  All support the use of '*'
to represent either a fully wildcarded NAME or TYPE.  RSTS/E  supports
the use of '?' to match any single character, whereas the others use a
'%' to match any single character.   The  RSTS/E  Kermit  server  will
translate  '%'  to  '?' internally for the GET and REMOTE DIR commands
(see chapter on the SERVER).

File systems on the PDP-11


Examples of wildcarded filenames:

        *.B2S           match any file with a TYPE of B2S
        K11%%%.MAC      match any file starting with K11, followed by
                        one to three characters, with a TYPE of MAC
        K11???.MAC      Same as above, but for RSTS/E only.
        XYZ.*;*         All versions of files with a NAME of XYZ with
                        any TYPE (RSX-11M/M+ and P/OS only).

File formats (binary and text)

RT-11 and TSX+

RT-11 treats all files as a contiguous stream of characters.  There is
no information stored in the directory to tell the system (or program)
that a file is readable text (source program, runoff document,...)  or
consists  of  binary  data  (executable  program,  object  file,  .SYS
file,...).  An application program like Kermit-11 needs to  know  what
type of file to expect, thus the presence of the SET FILE TYPE command
(discussed later).  The only real convention is that  text  files  are
streams  of  seven  bit data with each record terminated by a carriage
return/line feed character sequence and  that  binary  files  normally
follow a filename TYPE convention.  The TYPE (.SAV, .SYS, ...) is what
Kermit-11 will look at to decide if a file should be sent as a text or
binary file.

RSTS/E, P/OS and RSX-11M/M+

These systems can provide for a large number of  file  attributes  for
each  file  by  using  either FCS11 (RSX-11M/M+) or RMS11 (all).  Text
files are normally considered to be either STREAM format  (FB$STM)  or
VARIABLE with implied carriage control (FB$VAR and FB$CR).  RSTS/E has
historically defaulted to STREAM, whereas the RSX  based  systems  use
VARIABLE.  Kermit-11 follows those defaults when creating files unless
told to do so otherwise  by  the  presence  of  attribute  data.   The
conversion  of  the  internal  data  representation to one that can be
transmitted to another Kermit is transparent for these types of files.
Both  the  file  attributes  and  the  filename  TYPE  are examined by
Kermit-11 to determine if a file needs to  be  sent  as  a  text  file
(default) or a binary file.  Additionally, on RSTS/E Kermit checks the
file protection code, as one of the bits in it  is  used  to  flag  an
executable file (bit 6).

In all cases, unless (at this time) Kermit-11 is  talking  to  another
Kermit-11,  or if Kermit-11 can't tell if a file is consists of binary
data, the command SET FILE TYPE FIXED must be used to force Kermit  to
either  send  or  get  a  non-text  file correctly.  When Kermit-11 is
running in binary mode, all data is read from (or written to) the file
without  any  translation or internal record control information.  Any
attribute information in the file's directory entry is ignored and the
data  read  (or  written)  in 512 byte unformatted blocks.  Thus it is
indeed  possible  to  transfer  files  like  task  images  and  object
libraries.   Since  Kermit-11  supports a subset of a protocol feature
called 'attributes',  two  Kermit-11's  connected  together  can  also

File systems on the PDP-11


correctly transfer files other than simple text and unformatted binary
files, such as RMS indexed or relative files.

Saving files on the PDP-11 from your microcomputer

You  can  send  textual  files  to  Kermit-11  without   any   special
considerations  as  Kermit-11  defaults to creating normal text files.
However, if you are sending a binary file (perhaps an EXE)  from  say,
your  Rainbow  under MSDOS, you would need to tell Kermit-11 to expect
binary data.  This is done with the Kermit-11 command  SET  FILE  TYPE
FIXED.   This will force Kermit-11 to write the data out exactly as it
comes, in 512 byte unformatted records.  Sending the same file back to
the Rainbow would not require any special action since the file, as it
sits on the PDP-11, has the proper information in the directory  entry
to  tell  Kermit-11 that the file is binary.  As a note, for RT-11 you
would need to use a filetype that is normally considered 'binary' like
SAV or OBJ (see above notes for RT-11).

Never try to do a wildcarded send with mixed  binary  and  text  files
with  the file type set to FIXED.  The result could be unusable as not
all systems store text data in the same internal format.  For example,
if  Kermit-11  is forced into binary mode (via SET FIL TYP FIX) and is
requested to send a file with implied carriage control (normal for RSX
text  files),  it  will  actually  send,  for  each  line,  two  bytes
representing the record length, followed by the data and then followed
by  a  ascii  NUL  to  pad  the record to an even length.  That is not
incorrect, rather, it is EXACTLY how the data was stored on disk.

In general, avoid sending anything other than unformatted binary files
and  text  file  to  unlike  systems.   For  example, requesting a RMS
indexed file from the PDP-11 to be sent to a PC would  case  Kermit-11
to  send  it  as a binary file, but the file attributes would be lost.
Sending such a file back to the PDP-11 would  result  in  an  unusable
file unless you could reconstruct the attribute information.

Program Operation


Kermit-11's prompt is normally "Kermit-11>".  This can be  changed  if
need  be  via the SET PROMPT command.  Invoking Kermit-11 is very site
dependent.

RSTS/E

If Kermit-11 has a ccl definition, it would likely be invoked as "KER"
or  "KERMIT".   If  not,  try "RUN $KERMIT", as this is a likely place
where Kermit-11 may have  been  put.   Otherwise  consult  your  local
support staff.

RSX-11M/M+

If Kermit-11 has been installed, it most likely will have a task  name
of  ...KER  which means that type "KER" should get things running.  If
not, consult your local support staff.

RT-11/TSX+

On version 5 of RT-11, programs  can  be  run  simply  by  typing  the
filename.   Thus,  if  there  is  a  file  SY:KERMIT.SAV,  simply type
"KERMIT".  If  this  fails,  contact  your  local  support  staff  for
assistance.

P/OS

Kermit-11 is generally run from DCL on P/OS.  The program  is  invoked
via  the DCL RUN command, as in RUN K11POS or RUN KERMIT, depending on
what the task image name is.


Note that for the case where  Kermit  is  installed  (for  RSTS/E  and
RSX-11M/M+) that Kermit-11 can get command line arguments, as in:

        $ KER SERV                      Kermit starts as a server.
        > KER send fubar.txt            Kermit sends the file.

Otherwise, the  program  is  run  interactively  from  the  Kermit-11>
prompt.

        $ KERMIT
        Kermit-11 V2.33
        Kermit-11>SET BLO 3             Changes checksum type.
        Kermit-11>SER                   Enter Kermit server.

Note that whenever Kermit-11 starts up, it will always try to  find  a
file  called  KERMIT.INI  in  your  current  directory.  This file can
contain any valid Kermit command, though the usual use of this  is  to
place  various  Kermit-11  SET  commands in it.  If this file does NOT
exist, it will try to find it in LB:[1,2]KERMIT.INI (excluding RT-11).
In  addition  to  the  .INI file, commands may be placed in a file and
then executed via the Kermit-11 TAKE (or @) command.    

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                 Page 1-7
Local and Remote operation


Kermit-11 by default assumes that all file transfers will  occur  over
the terminal line that you are currently logged in on (TI:, TT:, KB:).
This is known as REMOTE mode (the PDP-11 is the remote system).   This
would be the desired case if you are running Kermit on a microcomputer
such as a Rainbow and are currently logged into the PDP-11 through the
micro.   However, if you wanted to dial out, say by an autodial modem,
from the PDP-11 to another system, you need to tell Kermit-11  to  use
some other terminal line.  This would be called LOCAL mode (the PDP-11
is the local system).  The line can  be  altered  with  the  SET  LINE
command  (see section on SET and CONNECT).  A SET LINE command is done
implicitly if Kermit-11 finds  itself  running  on  a  PRO/350,  under
either P/OS, RT-11 or TSX+.

Since support of parity varies by both interface type (DL11  vs  DZ11)
and  by  operating system, Kermit-11 makes NO attempt to find out what
the current parity of it's line  is.   Kermit-11  generates  it's  own
parity which is set with the SET PARITY command.

There are a couple of things to  point  out  regarding  Kermit-11  and
LOCAL mode (you did a SET LINE command).

     The system manager may have lines other than your  own  protected
     (or  owned  by  the  system).   On  RSTS/E  lines  are often made
     unaccessible   unless   your   account   possesses   the   needed
     privilege(s).   On  RSX-11M/M+,  privilege  is  required to alter
     settings on any other terminal line.  You may  have  to  talk  to
     your system manager to get access to an outgoing terminal line.

     Once connected to a modem through  another  line,  a  means  must
     exist  for  the  connection  to  be  broken  (if the host you are
     calling won't do it).  Given that your line has full  or  partial
     modem  control  (DZV11,  DZ11, DH11, DHU/V11) the RSX, RT-11/TSX+
     and RSTS/E Kermits have a HANGUP (or DISCONNECT)  command,  which
     instructs  the  system  to  disconnect the modem.  Unless this is
     done, you never get disconnected and could run up  a  tidy  phone
     bill.


Kermit-11 has, as of v3.53, a rudimentary command  line  editor.   You
can  recall  previous  commands  with  the  UP-Arrow key, and exit the
command with the LEFT and  RIGHT  arrow  keys.   The  RUBOUT  key,  of
course,  deletes characters, while the control R key retypes the line.
Control E moves to the end of the line and  control  H  moves  to  the
start of the line.

Commands for file transfer


                           The SEND Command

Sending a file or files:

    SEND filespec

The SEND command causes a file or file  group  to  be  sent  from  the
PDP-11  to the other system.  If filespec contains wildcard characters
then all matching files will be sent, in alphabetical order (according
to  the  ASCII  collating  sequence)  by  name.   If filespec does not
contain any wildcard characters, then the  single  file  specified  by
filespec will be sent.


SEND Command General Operation:

Files will be sent with their PDP-11 file name and type (for  instance
FOO.BAR).   Each  file  will  be sent according to the record type and
attributes recorded in its file  descriptor.   Kermit-11  attempts  to
translate  all  formats of text file to a format usable on any system.
Note that there is no need to set the FILE TYPE parameter for  sending
files,  since  Kermit-11  always  uses  the  information from the file
directory entry and the filetype (extension) to determine how to  send
the file.

If communication line parity is being used (see SET PARITY), Kermit-11
will  request  that  the  other  Kermit  use  a special kind of prefix
notation for binary files.  This is an advanced feature, and  not  all
Kermits  have  it;  if  the  other  Kermit  does not agree to use this
feature,  binary  files  cannot  be  sent  correctly.   This  includes
executable  programs  (like  .EXE files, CP/M .COM files), relocatable
object modules (.OBJ files), as  well  as  any  text  file  containing
characters with the eighth bit on.

Kermit-11 will also ask the other  Kermit  whether  it  can  handle  a
special  prefix  encoding  for  repeated  characters.  If it can, then
files with long strings of repeated  characters  will  be  transmitted
very  efficiently.   Columnar  data,  highly indented text, and binary
files are the major beneficiaries of this technique.

If you're running Kermit-11 locally, for instance dialing out  from  a
PDP-11  to another system using an autodialer, you should have already
run Kermit on the remote system and  issued  either  a  RECEIVE  or  a
SERVER command.  Once you give Kermit-11 the SEND command, the name of
each file will be displayed on your screen as the transfer begins.  As
the  transfer  continues,  you  will get a small display of the packet
count along with the number of packets rejected.  See the SET TERMINAL
and  SET  UPDATE  commands  for  more  information.  You may also type
Control-X or Control-Z to interrupt the current file  or  file  group.
Control-E will also abort the transfer by sending an 'error' packet to
the other Kermit.

Commands for file transfer


                         The RECEIVE command

Syntax:  RECEIVE [filespec]

The RECEIVE command tells Kermit-11 to receive a file  or  file  group
from  the  other  system.   The  name  is taken from the incoming file
header.

If an incoming file has the same name as an existing  file,  Kermit-11
will  by default create a new file.  On RT-11 and RSTS/E, the old file
will be deleted by the executive.  On RSX-11M/M+ and P/OS, a new  file
with  a  higher  version number will be created.  To avoid files being
superceded, see the SET FILE [NO]SUPERCEDE command.

Incoming files will all be stored with the prevailing file type, ASCII
by  default,  which  is appropriate for text files.  If you are asking
Kermit-11 to receive binary files from a microcomputer or other  8-bit
system,  you must first type SET FILE TYPE FIXED.  Otherwise, an error
may occur when receiving the file.  Please note  that  this  does  NOT
apply to two Kermit-11 programs connected to each other.  In that case
the sending Kermit-11 will tell the receiving Kermit-11 to  switch  to
binary mode if need be.

If parity is being used  on  the  communications  line,  then  8th-bit
prefixing will be requested.  If the other side cannot do this, binary
files cannot be transferred correctly.

If you are running Kermit-11 locally, you should already have issued a
SEND command to the remote Kermit, and then escaped back to Kermit-11.
As files arrive, their names will be displayed on your screen.

If a file arrives that you don't  really  want,  you  can  attempt  to
cancel  it  by  typing Control-X; this sends a cancellation request to
the remote Kermit.  If the remote Kermit understands this request (not
all  implementations  of Kermit support this feature), it will comply;
otherwise it will continue to send.  If a file group  is  being  sent,
you can request the entire group be cancelled by typing Control-Z.

Normally, one runs the remote Kermit as a  SERVER,  thus  the  RECEIVE
command  is  never  used,  rather, the GET command, described next, is
used.

                           The GET command

Syntax:  GET [remote-filespec]

The GET command requests a remote Kermit server to send  the  file  or
file  group  specified  by  remote-filespec.  This command can be used
only when Kermit-11 is local, with a Kermit server on the other end of
the  line  specified  by  SET  LINE.   This  means  that you must have
CONNECTed to the other system, logged in, run Kermit there, issued the
SERVER command, and escaped back to the PDP-11.

The  remote  filespec  is  any  string  that  can  be  a  legal   file

Commands for file transfer


specification  for  the  remote  system; it is not parsed or validated
locally.  Any leading spaces before the remote filespec are  stripped,
and lower case characters are raised to upper case.

As files arrive, their names will be displayed on your screen.  As  in
the  RECEIVE  command, ^X to request that the current incoming file be
cancelled, ^Z to request that the entire incoming batch be cancelled.

If the remote Kermit is not capable of server functions, then you will
probably get an error message back from it like "Illegal packet type".
In this case, you must connect  to  the  other  Kermit,  give  a  SEND
command, escape back, and give a RECEIVE command.

                           Server operation

The SERVER command puts a remote Kermit-11 in "server mode",  so  that
it  receives  all  further  commands in packets from the local Kermit.
The Kermit-11 server is capable (as of this writing) of executing  the
following  remote  server  commands:   SEND,  GET, FINISH, BYE, REMOTE
DIRECTORY, REMOTE CWD,  REMOTE  SPACE,  REMOTE  DELETE,  REMOTE  TYPE,
REMOTE  HELP, REMOTE COPY, REMOTE RENAME, REMOTE WHO, REMOTE LOGIN and
REMOTE HOST.

Any nonstandard parameters should be selected with SET commands before
putting  Kermit-11 into server mode, in particular the file type.  The
Kermit-11  server  can  send  all  files   in   the   correct   manner
automatically.   As noted before, if a Kermit-11 is talking to another
Kermit-11, they will negotiate any 'binary' parameters  automatically.
However,  if  this  is  NOT  the case and you need to ask Kermit-11 to
receive binary files you must issue the  SET  FILE  TYPE  FIX  command
before putting it into server mode, and then you must only send binary
files.  You cannot send a mixture of text files and 8-bit binary files
to a Kermit-11 server unless the files are not for use on the PDP-11.

                         Command for Servers

When running in local mode, Kermit-11 allows you to give a wide  range
of  commands to a remote Kermit server, with no guarantee the that the
remote server can process them, since they are all  optional  features
of the protocol.  Commands for servers include the standard SEND, GET,
BYE, FINISH commands, as well as the REMOTE command.


The BYE command

The BYE command tells a remote server to log out of the remote system.
In  addition,  some  remote  systems will also disconnect the line for
you.  If this is not the case, the DISCONNECT command will  (depending
on your interface) cause the line to be dropped.  See DISCONNECT.

The FINISH command

The FINISH command tells the remote  Kermit  server  to  exit  without
logging  out  of  the remote system.  You can then CONNECT back to the

Server operation


system.

REMOTE command

Send the specified command to the remote server.  If the  server  does
not  understand  the  command  (all  of  these  commands  are optional
features of the Kermit protocol), it will reply with  a  message  like
"Unknown Kermit server command".  If does understand, it will send the
results back, and they will be displayed on the  screen.   The  REMOTE
commands are:

REMOTE COPY filespec newfilespec

     Copy file.  The server is asked to make a copy of  the  specified
     file.   Both  filespecs  must  be  in  the correct format for the
     remote system.  Kermit-11 does not parse  or  validate  the  file
     specifications.   Any  leading  spaces will be stripped and lower
     case characters converted to upper case.  Note that this  command
     simply  provides  for copying a file within the server's system -
     it does not cause a file to be transferred.

REMOTE CWD directory

     Change Working Directory.  If no directory name is provided,  the
     server  will  change to the default or home directory.  Kermit-11
     currently does not ask for a password.

REMOTE DELETE filespec

     Delete the specified file or files.  The names of the files  that
     are deleted will appear on your screen.

REMOTE DIRECTORY [filespec]

     The names of the files that match the  given  file  specification
     will  be  displayed  on  your screen, perhaps along with size and
     date information for each file.   If  no  file  specification  is
     given, all files from the current directory will be listed.

REMOTE HELP

     The remote server will send back a list of server  commands  that
     it can execute.

REMOTE HOST command

     Pass the given command to the server's  host  command  processor,
     and  display the resulting output on your screen.  Not all Kermit
     servers can do this function.  In the case of Kermit-11, only the
     RSTS/E Kermit-11 server can execute the REMOTE HOST command.

REMOTE LOGIN user password

     Ask a remote server to log into a different account or  username.

Server operation


     The  support  for  this  command  is  rarely  implemented as many
     systems  layer  login/logout  support  over  the  executive.    A
     Kermit-11  server  can  only  support this on RSTS/E, and at that
     only for version  9.0  or  later.   Of  the  various  DEC  PDP-11
     operating systems, only RSTS/E has the support for logging in and
     out built into the executive and accessible with directives.

REMOTE RENAME oldfile newfile

     Change the name on the specified  file  (or  files).   Both  file
     specifications must be valid for the server's system.

REMOTE SPACE

     Display information about disk usage in the current directory.

REMOTE TYPE filespec

     Display the contents of the specified file on your screen.

REMOTE WHO

     Display current status of user's logged in.



Commands for Local File Management

These commands provide some local file management  capability  without
having  to  leave  the  Kermit-11  program.   These  commands are very
similar to the REMOTE commands in function and syntax.  They  are  all
executed  locally, and are available when Kermit-11 is either local or
remote.  The arguments to these commands are the same as the arguments
expected  from  the user Kermit when Kermit-11 is processing a command
in server mode.  Additionally, these commands can be prefixed  by  the
LOCAL keyword.

        COPY filespec newfilespec
        CWD directory
        DELETE filespec
        DIRECTORY [filespec]
        HELP
        HOST command
        RENAME oldfile newfile
        SPACE
        TYPE filespec
        WHO



Connect

The CONNECT command will allow you to connect in as a virtual terminal
over  the line that was specified by the set line command.  (Using the

The Connect command


CONNECT command before using the SET LINE command will  result  in  an
error  message)  The  terminal line must be one which is accessible to
the user.  The format of the CONNECT command is:

                Kermit-11>CONNECT

The distributed RSX-11M/M+ task has been built with the  /PR:0  switch
to  enable  the task to change other terminal settings.  Additionally,
for RSX-11M/M+, the MCR  command  SET  /SLAVE=TTnn:   should  be  done
before entering Kermit-11.

If you are running K11POS.TSK on a PRO/350, Kermit will set  the  line
to XK0:  and the speed to 9600 by default.

Please note that Kermit-11 CAN NOT change the speed  of  a  DL11  type
interface,  nor  can  it change the speed of a PDT-150 modem port (use
SPEED.SAV).

The following is an example of using a Racal-Vadic  VA212  autodialing
modem  to  log  into  a  remote TOPS-20 system.  There is one point at
which there is no echoing of the user input,  this  is  following  the
typing  of  the local 'escape sequence', which by default is control \
followed by  a  'c'.   The  control  backslash  informs  the  terminal
emulator  that  the  next  character  is a command.  In this case, the
command was 'C', which means to return to  the  local  PDP-11  system.
Control  \  ?   would print a help message.  All the commands prior to
the DIAL command were contained in the INI file, KERMIT.INI.

SET

The SET command is used to set  various  parameters  in  kermit.   The
format of the SET command is:

                Kermit-11>SET parameter keyword


SET ATTRIBUTES

Part of the  Kermit  protocol  is  the  support  of  file  attributes.
Connected Kermits that support this can send information to each other
about file size, time/date of creation, RMS  file  headers  and  other
useful   things.    Due   to   potential  problems  with  incompatible
implementations this feature can  be  disabled.   In  this  case,  the
sending  Kermit-11 will never try to send file attributes, even though
the receiver may have indicated that it supports this.

                Kermit-11>SET ATTRIBUTES OFF
                Kermit-11>SET ATTRIBUTES ON


SET BAUD

This is the same as SET SPEED.  See HELP SET SPEED

SET BINARY-TYPE

Kermit-11 has a default list of filetypes that are scanned  to  decide
if  a  file should be sent in binary mode in addition to checking file
attributes for RSX, P/OS and RSTS/E.  The user can, however,  override
this  list  with  the  this  command.   The  default  list  is  fairly
inclusive, with types such as .SAV and  .TSK  forcing  Kermit-11  into
binary transmission.  See HELP SET FIL for the default list.

        Kermit-11> SET BINARY-TYPE .SAV
        Kermit-11> SET BIN .EXE

The SET COMMAND




SET BLOCK-CHECK

The SET BLOCKCHECK command  is  used  to  determine  the  block  check
sequence  which  will  be  used  during transmission.  The block check
sequence is used to detect transmission errors.  There are three types
of  block  check  available.   These are the single character checksum
(default), the two character checksum, and  the  three  character  CRC
(cyclic  redundancy  check).   This  command  does not ensure that the
desired type of block check will be used, since both Kermit's involved
in  the  transfer  must agree on the block check type.  Kermit-11 will
request that the type of block check set by this command be used for a
transfer.   If the other Kermit has also had the same block check type
requested, then the desired block check type will be used.  Otherwise,
the  single  character  checksum  will be used.  The command should be
given to BOTH Kermits since Kermit-11, when in server mode, has no say
about  what  kind  of  checksum it wants to use.  (See Kermit protocol
manual for more information.)

           Kermit-11>SET BLOCK_CHECK keyword
           Kermit-11>SET BLO 1
           Kermit-11>SET BLO 2
           Kermit-11>SET BLO 3

Where keyword is one of:

          1_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM or ONE_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM

          2_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM or TWO_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM

          3_CHARACTER_CRC_CCITT or THREE_CHARACTER_CRC_CCITT


SET CONSOLE

The SET CONSOLE command is used under P/OS to control the passing of 8
bit  data  to  th  terminal  during  the  connect command.  If you are
getting multinational characters being printed, this is a very  useful
thing to set.  The default is SET CON 7.

        Kermit-11>SET CON 8
        Kermit-11>SET CON 7


SET DEBUG

The SET DEBUG command is  used  to  specify  the  type  and  level  of
debugging  to  a disk file .  This disk file must have been created by
the SET LOGFILE command.  The format for SET DEBUG is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG qualifier

The SET COMMAND


SET DEBUG ALL

SET DEBUG ALL will turn on logging for CONSOLE,CONNECT,FILE,PACKET and
STATE  to the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is the
same as SET DEBUG ON.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG ALL


SET DEBUG CONSOLE

SET DEBUG CONSOLE will turn on logging for all  i/o  during  a  remote
connect  to  the  disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is
the same as SET DEBUG CONNECT.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG CONSOLE


SET DEBUG CONNECT

SET DEBUG CONNECT will turn on logging for all  i/o  during  a  remote
connect  to  the  disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is
the same as SET DEBUG CONSOLE.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG CONNECT


SET DEBUG FILE

SET DEBUG FILE will log all file 'opens' and  'creates'  to  the  file
specified by SET LOGFILE.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG FILE


SET DEBUG HELP

SET DEBUG HELP gives the user a list of all qualifiers  which  can  be
used with SET DEBUG.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG HELP


SET DEBUG NONE

SET DEBUG NONE 'turns off' all debugging.  This is the same as the SET
DEBUG OFF command.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG NONE


SET DEBUG OFF

SET DEBUG OFF 'turns off' all debugging.  This is the same as the  SET

DEBUG NONE command.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG OFF


SET DEBUG ON

SET DEBUG ON will'turn on' logging for CONSOLE,CONNECT,FILE,PACKET and
STATE  to the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is the
same as SET DEBUG ALL.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG ON


SET DEBUG PACKET

SET DEBUG PACKET will 'turn on' logging of all  receive  and  transmit
packets to the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  The command format
is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG PACKET


SET DEBUG STATE

SET DEBUG STATE will turn on logging of all internal  Kermit-11  state
transitions

SET DELAY

The DELAY parameter is the number of seconds to  wait  before  sending
data  after  a  SEND command is given.  This is used when Kermit-11 is
running in remote mode to allow the user time to escape  back  to  the
other Kermit and give a RECEIVE command.

           Kermit-11>SET DELAY number-of-seconds

Where number of seconds is the (decimal)  number  of  second  to  wait
before sending data.

SET DEFAULT

The DEFAULT parameter allows you to specify a device and UIC (or  PPN)
for  all  subsequent  file  opens  (for SENDING) and file creates (for
RECEIVING).  It is disabled by typing SET HOME.

                Kermit-11>SET DEFAULT device
                Kermit-11>SET DEFAULT DB2:[200,201]

This is quite useful for Kermit-11 running on a DECNET  link,  as  you
can  set  the  default  for  file operations to include node names and
passwords as in:

                Kermit-11>set def orion::sys$system:[fubar]

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-19
The SET COMMAND




SET DIAL

Kermit-11 has knowledge built in to it of a number of the more  common
'smart'  autodial  modems.   To  find  out  if  your modem is directly
supported try the command SET MODEM ?.  If your modem is not  in  this
list then you need the SET DIAL command to generate the data base used
by Kermit to control the  modem.   Kermit  uses  this  information  to
implement  the  DIAL command.  A command such as DIAL can only be done
when Kermit knows both how to format commands to the modem,  and  what
kind  of  text  the  modem  will  send  back to it in response.  As an
example, the VADIC VA212PA modem is awakened from an idle state by the
character sequence (in octal)

        05 015

which is a Control E followed by a carriage return.   In  response  to
this two character string, the modem responds with:

        HELLO: I'M READY
        *

Thus Kermit has to know that when it  sends  the  wakeup  sequence  it
needs  to wait for the asterisk to be sent back by the modem.  At this
point Kermit will know that the modem is in a state  awaiting  further
commands, such as that to dial a phone number.

It is not possible for Kermit  to  have  knowledge  of  all  makes  of
modems.  Instead Kermit supports a command called:

        Kermit-11>SET MODEM USER_DEFINED

which then allows you to use the SET DIAL command to inform Kermit how
the  modem works.  Once Kermit knows how to control the modem, you can
use the DIAL command to initiate a call from Kermit.

The SET DIAL commands are:

        SET DIAL WAKEUP         define the wakeup string
        SET DIAL PROMPT         define the prompt the modem uses
        SET DIAL INITIATE       define a string to start dialing
        SET DIAL CONFIRM        define the string to confirm number
        SET DIAL FORMAT         define the number formatting string
        SET DIAL SUCCESS        define string(s) for call complete
        SET DIAL INFO           define string(s) for informative text
        SET DIAL FAILURE        define string(s) for call failure
        SET DIAL CONFIRM        define string for number confirmation
        SET DIAL WAKE_RATE      set pause time between wakeup characters
        SET DIAL DIAL_RATE      set pause time between number digits
        SET DIAL DIAL_PAUSE     define string for dial tone pause


Suppose we had to tell Kermit about  the  Racal  Vadic  VA212PA  modem

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-20
The SET COMMAND


(though in reality Kermit already knows about that kind).  In checking
the owners manual for it, we find that:

     To wake the modem up, we type a control E followed by a  carriage
     return.

     To dial a number, we type the letter D  followed  by  a  carriage
     return.   At  this  point, the modem prints a NUMBER?  prompt, we
     then type the desired number in.  It reprints the number and then
     waits  for  a  carriage return from us to confirm that its really
     the correct phone number.

     When it completes dialing, it will print 'ON  LINE'  or  'ONLINE'
     for  a  successful call, otherwise it may display on the terminal
     'BUSY', 'FAILED CALL', 'NO DIAL', 'VOICE' or 'TIME  OUT'.   While
     it  is waiting for its call to be answered, it may print the line
     'RINGING' several times in order to tell you that it  is  working
     on it.


The Kermit commands required would be:

        Kermit-11>SET MODEM USER_DEFINED
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL WAKEUP \05\015
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL PROMPT *
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL INITIATE D\015
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FORMAT %P%S\015
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL CONFIRM \015
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL SUCCESS ONLINE
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL SUCCESS ON LINE
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL INFO RINGING
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE BUSY
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE FAILED CALL
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE NO DIAL
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE VOICE
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE TIME OUT
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL DIAL_PAUSE 9K
        Kermit-11>DIAL 14195551212

The notation "\05\015" indicates the Control E followed by a  carriage
return;  05  is octal for control E, 015 is octal for carriage return.
An alternate notation for octal numbers can be  used  by  placing  the
value  inside  of inequality characters, as in SET DIAL WAKE <05><015>
though the former is preferred.
The notation "%P%S\015" indicates to Kermit that the phone number from
the  dial  command  is  to be followed by a carriage return; the %S is
simply a placeholder for the phone number.  The presence of the %P  is
to  indicate  where  to  insert the dial pause string, in this case we
need to dial 9 and wait for a second dial tone.  The "K" is the  Racal
Vadic  code to get the modem to pause.  If you are dialing on a direct
line, the DIAL_PAUSE command is unneeded.  If for any reason you  need
to  pass  a "\" or "<" to your modem, simply prefix the character with
another "\", as in "\\".

The SET COMMAND


Many modems  require  only  the  WAKEUP,  PROMPT,  FORMAT  and  result
strings.   The  Digital  DF112  is an example of this; it's definition
would look like:

        Kermit-11>SET MODEM USER_DEFINED
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL WAKEUP \02
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL PROMPT READY
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FORMAT %S#
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL SUCCESS ATTACHED
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE BUSY
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE DISCONNECTED
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE ERROR
        Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE NO ANSWER

Some modems may be unable to accept data at the line  speed;  in  this
case  we  would  need  to  use  the  SET  DIAL  WAKE_RATE and SET DIAL
DIAL_RATE.  These two commands accept a delay  time  in  milliseconds;
the  actual  delay  will  not  be  precise  as  the  PDP-11 line clock
interrupts sixty times per second.  Furthermore, on RSTS/E the  finest
granularity for timing is one second; thus setting delays would result
in delays of one second increments.

In general, not all of the result fields need be specified except  for
the  call  completed strings; Kermit will time out after a while if it
can't match a response with any definitions.

Further information can be found in the sections on SET  MODEM,  DIAL,
REDIAL and SET PHONE.


SET DTR

The SET DTR command is very similar  to  the  DISCONNECT  (or  HANGUP)
command.   SET  DTR,  where  supported, raises DTR for a predetermined
amount of time, whereas the DISCONNECT (or HANGUP) command drops  DTR.
The  SET  DTR is only functional on RSTS/E, which by default keeps DTR
low until either RING INDICATOR or CARRIER DETECT goes high.  This  is
opposite of the behavior on RT11 and RSX11M/M+, both of which normally
assert DTR.  The SET DTR command raises DTR for at  least  30  seconds
(depending  on  the  version  of  RSTS/E)  and  is  useful  for making
connections to front end switches (such as  MICOM  and  GANDALF).   On
RT11,  SET DTR is identical to the HANGUP command; it simply drops DTR
for two seconds.  In this case (RT11 and TSX+) this  command  is  only
supported  on  RT11  5.2  and  TSX+ 6.0 with the XL/XC and CL drivers,
respectively.  This command is a no-op on  RSX11M/M+  and  P/OS.   For
further  information on modem support, see the later section regarding
such.


SET DUPLEX

The DUPLEX parameter controls whether an outgoing link  (set  via  the

after the CONNECT command to be echoed locally.

                Kermit-11>SET DUPLEX HALF
                Kermit-11>SET DUPLEX FULL



SET END-OF-LINE

The END-OF-LINE parameter sets the ascii character which will be  used
as  a  line terminator for all packets SENT to the other KERMIT.  This
is normally not needed for most versions of KERMIT.

                Kermit-11>SET END-OF-LINE octal value of character


SET ESCAPE

This command will set the escape character for the CONNECT processing.
The  command  will take the octal value of the character to use as the
escape character.  This is the character which  is  used  to  "escape"
back  to  Kermit-11  after  using the CONNECT command.  It defaults to
control (octal 34).  It is usually a good idea to set  this  character
to something which is not used (or at least not used very much) on the
system being to which Kermit-11 is CONNECTing.

           Kermit-11>SET ESCAPE octal-character-value

Where octal-character-value is the ASCII value of the character to use
as the escape character (in octal).

SET FILE

The SET FILE allows you to set various file related parameters.

        Kermit-11>SET FIL option


SET FILE TYPE ASCII

File type ASCII is for text files.  SET FILE TYPE TEXT is the same.

SET FILE TYPE AUTO

Kermit-11 will normally try to decide if a file must be sent in binary
mode based on the file attributes and filetype.  If, for instance, the
directory entry for FUBAR.TXT showed it  to  be  RMS  (or  FCS)  fixed
length  records,  Kermit-11  will  switch  to  binary mode and send it
verbatim.  If the receiving Kermit  is  Kermit-11,  then  the  sending
Kermit  will  send attribute data over also.  The following file types
also will normally be sent as binary files unless you use the SET FILE
TYPE NOAUTO command.

                *.TSK   ; rsx, ias, and rsts tasks

                *.SAV   ; rt11 and rsts save images
                *.OBJ   ; compiler and mac output
                *.STB   ; tkband link symbol tables
                *.CRF   ; tkb and link cross reference files
                *.TSD   ; 'time shared dibol' for rt11
                *.BAC   ; rsts basic+ 'compiled' files

                *.RTS   ; rsts/e run time systems
                *.EXE   ; vms executable

SET FILE TYPE BINARY

File type BINARY is for non-text files.  Note that binary files  which
are generated on a PDP-11 system cannot be transferred to another (non
PDP-11) system without losing file attributes.  This means  that  (for
example),  an  RSM11 indexed file cannot be transmitted with Kermit-11
at this time.  You can not have parity set to anything but NONE to use
binary file transfer (see HELP SET PARITY) unless the other Kermit can
process eight bit quoting.  Two Kermit-11's connected  to  each  other
will  use  binary  transmission automatically via the Kermit attribute
packets, preserving file attributes where it makes sense  (ie,  RSTS/E
and RSX only).

SET FILE TYPE DECMULTINATIONAL

PDP-11 Kermit normally strips the high bit of every character on  both
transmission  and  reception  of files (unless the SET FILE TYPE FIXED
command was given).  The SET FIL DEC command will cause  Kermit-11  to
leave all data intact but still obey the host file system when reading
or writing files.   In  other  words,  Kermit  will  write  sequential
implied  carriage control files with eight bit data if this command is
used.

SET FILE TYPE FIXED

This is the same as SET FIL TYP BIN

SET FILE TYPE NOAUTO

SET  FILE  NOAUTO  disables  Kermit-11  from  trying  to  base  binary
transmission mode on file attributes or filetype.

SET FILE SUPERCEDE

SET FILE [NO]SUPERCEDE allows Kermit-11  to  accept  or  reject  files
received  (from  either  the  RECEIVE  or  GET commands) on a per file
basis.  The default is  SUPERCEDE.   By  doing  SET  FILE  NOSUPERCEDE
Kermit-11  will  always  check  to  see  if  the file to be created is
already there (independent of version number) and  reject  it  to  the
sending  server  if  it exists.  This presumes that the Kermit sending
the file understands the protocol to reject one file of  a  (possibly)
wildcarded group of files.
The main use of this is to resume getting a group of files, as in  GET

The SET COMMAND


KER:K11*.*  or  GET  KER:MS????.*  having  lost  the  connection after
transferring some of the files.   If  this  is  set,  then  any  files
already transferred will not be transferred again.

        Kermit-11>SET FILE SUPERCEDE
        Kermit-11>SET FILE NOSUPERCEDE


SET HOME

SET HOME resets the default device and UIC (or PPN)  to  nothing,  ie,
all  file  opens  and creates use your default disk (SY:) and your UIC
(or PPN).

                Kermit-11>SET HOME


SET IBM-MODE

The SET IBM ON (or OFF) will instruct Kermit-11 to  wait  for  an  XON
following  each packet sent to an IBM host.  Since the default for IBM
mode may not always be appropriate for your IBM compatible system, you
can  always use the SET HANDSHAKE XON and SET DUPLEX HALF to avoid the
parity setting implied by using IBM mode.

                Kermit-11>SET IBM ON
                Kermit-11>SET IBM OFF


SET LINE

The SET LINE command sets the  terminal  name  up  for  use  with  the
connect command.  To use this you must have access to that device.  On
many systems terminal lines other than your  own  are  protected  from
access, and may require special procedures to access them.
The form of the device name is TTnnn:, where 'nnn' is a decimal number
for  RSTS  and  an octal number for RSX-11M/M+.  For RT-11, the device
name is simply the MT unit number shown by the SHO TER command, as  in
'5'  for DZ11 unit 0 line 4.  If the system is running RT-11 version 5
you can do a SET LIN XL:.   At  worst  case,  Kermit-11  can  use  the
console  port  on  RT-11.  For more information see the notes later on
for RT-11 If you are running  K11POS.TSK  for  P/OS  on  the  PRO/350,
Kermit-11  will  set the line to XK0:  and the speed to 9600 baud when
Kermit starts.  To override the line or speed, set HELP SET  LINE  and
HELP SET SPEED.

        Kermit-11>SET LINE TT55:        (for RSTS and RSX-11M/M+)
        Kermit-11>SET LINE 5            (for RT-11 and MT service)
        Kermit-11>SET LINE XK0:         (for P/OS, done implicitly)
        Kermit-11>SET LINE XL:          (for RT-11 and XL handler)

See HELP CONNECT,  HELP  SET  DUPLEX  and  HELP  SET  SPEED  for  more
information.   Also,  for TSX+, see notes regarding TSX later in these
notes.  The RT-11 XL handler has notes later on also.

The SET COMMAND


SET LOGFILE

The SET LOGFILE command creates a debug dump file for you.  It must be
used  BEFORE  any  SET DEBUG commands can be used.  See HELP DEBUG for
further information about debugging modes.

                Kermit-11>SET LOGFILE MYLOG.TXT
                Created debug file MYLOG.TXT

SET MODEM

The SET MODEM command defines the type of MODEM use for dialing out on
the  line  set  with  the  SET  LINE  command,  or, in the case of the
PRO/350, the XC or XK port.  There are only a few  modems  defined  at
this time, they are:

                VADIC           Generic RACAL-VADIC autodial
                VA212PA         Stand alone VADIC VA212
                VA212PAR        Rack mounted VADIC VA212
                VA4224          Rack mounted VADIC VA4224 .v22bis
                HAYES           Hayes smartmodem
                DF100           DEC DF112
                DF200           DEC DF224
                DF03            DEC DF03
                MICROCOM

The DIAL command is then  used  after  the  SET  MODEM  command.   For
example, on a PRO/350 running P/OS:

                Kermit-11>set pro PRO>
                PRO>set modem va212pa
                PRO>dial 5374411
                Modem in command modem
                Modem dialing
                Connection made, type CONNECT to access remote
                PRO>con
                Enter class ? VX785A
                Class start
                Username: BRIAN
                Password: ......................

                and so on


SET PACKET-LENGTH

You can alter the default  transmitted  packet  length  with  the  SET
PACKET-LENGTH  command.  This should not normally be needed unless the
line is very noisy, at which time you should probably give up anyway.

                Kermit-11>SET PACKET 60


PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-26
The SET COMMAND


SET PARITY

This is used with the SET LINE and CONNECT  commands  to  specify  the
type  of  parity  for the remote link.  It defaults to NONE and can be
either ODD, EVEN, MARK or SPACE as in:

                Kermit-11>SET PARITY NONE
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY ODD
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY EVEN
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY MARK
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY SPACE

All parity generation is done via software,  no  special  hardware  is
used.   The  use  of software parity generation is restricted to 8 bit
links only.  The character format, if parity is set  to  anything  but
NONE,  will be 7 bits of data followed with high bit set or cleared to
indicate the parity.  If you set parity  to  anything  but  NONE  (the
default),  Kermit-11 will be forced to request 8bit prefixing from the
other Kermit-11, which is a method by which Kermit can 'prefix'  eight
bit  characters  with a shift code.  You MUST use parity (even if MARK
or SPACE) when using Kermit-11 with the IBM CMS Series/1 or 7171  3270
emulator.

SET PAUSE

PAUSE tells Kermit to wait the specified  number  of  seconds  between
each  packet being sent to the other Kermit.  This may be useful under
situations of heavy system load.  This may be  automatically  computer
by Kermit-11 in a future release as a function of line speed.

                Kermit-11>SET PAUSE 1


SET PHONE

The SET PHONE NUMBER command allows you to associate  a  phone  number
with  a  symbolic  name  for  later  use with the DIAL command.  These
definitions  could  be  placed  in  your  KERMIT.INI  file,  and  then
referenced later.

                Kermit-11>SET PHO NUM WORK 5374411
                Kermit-11>SET PHO NUM MARKET 16174671234
                Kermit-11>DIAL WORK

The other two SET PHONE options, SET PHONE [TONE][PULSE] and SET PHONE
BLIND  are not useful unless the appropiate dial formatting string and
character sequences for selecting PULSE or TONE, and BLIND dialing are
present  in  the  modem  definition  macros in K11DIA.MAC.  The format
effector for TONE/PULSE is %M  and  the  effector  for  BLIND  is  %B.
Currently (in 3.54) only the VA4224 has entries for these options.

SET POS

The SET POS command allows options SPECIFIC to  P/OS  to  be  altered.

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-27
The SET COMMAND


The  most  useful  option is the SET POS [NO]DTE command.  This allows
Kermit-11 to use PRO/Communications version 2 for terminal  emulation,
if this product has been installed on the PRO/350.  Of course, if this
option is chosen, control is returned to the PRO  with  the  EXIT  key
(F10) rather than with Control \C.

                Kermit-11>SET POS DTE
                Kermit-11>SET POS NODTE

SET PROMPT

The SET PROMPT command is useful if you are using two  Kermit-11's  to
talk  to  each other.  By using the SET PROMPT command, you can change
the prompt from 'Kermit-11>' on either (or both) Kermit  to  something
that would indicate which system you are currently connected to.

                Kermit-11>SET PROMPT KERMIT-11/1170>
                Kermit-11>SET PROMPT FUBAR>
                Kermit-11>SET PROMPT PROKERMIIT-11>


SET RECEIVE

Currently the SET RECEIVE and SET SEND basically work the same in that
they  only  alter  the  END-OF-LINE  character and the START-OF-PACKET
value, as in:

                Kermit-11>SET REC START 2
                Kermit-11>SET REC END 12

The command SET RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH command is discussed below.

SET RECEIVE END-OF-LINE

This instructs Kermit-11 to expect something other  than  the  default
carriage  return  (octal  15)  at the end of a packet.  Kermit-11 will
ignore packet terminators.  The SET SEND END command is of more use in
conditioning outgoing packets.

SET RECEIVE START-OF-PACKET

The normal Kermit packet prefix is Control-A (1); this command changes
the  prefix  Kermit-11  expects on incoming packets.  The only reasons
this should ever  be  changed  would  be:   Some  piece  of  equipment
somewhere  between  the  two  Kermit  programs will not pass through a
Control-A; or, some piece of of equipment similarly placed is  echoing
its  input.   In  the  latter  case, the recipient of such an echo can
change the packet prefix for outbound packets  to  be  different  from
that  of  arriving packets so that the echoed packets will be ignored.
The opposite Kermit must also be told to change  the  prefix  for  its
inbound packets and the prefix it uses on outgoing packets.

                Kermit-11>SET REC START-OF-PACKET 2


PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-28
The SET COMMAND


SET RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH

This command has two functions.  The first,  and  normal  one,  is  to
reduce  incoming  packet lengths in the event that normal sized Kermit
packets can not be passed through the communications  circuit.   There
could  be,  perhaps, some 'black box' somewhere in the link that has a
very small buffer size; this command could be used to reduce the  size
that the SENDING Kermit will use.

The other use is to enable a new protocol extension to  Kermit  called
'LONG  PACKETS'.   The  actual protocol is documented elsewhere, let's
just say that this is a way for two Kermit's to use packet  sizes  far
greater  than  the  normal ('Classic') packet size if 90 characters or
so.  The main use of this feature is in file transfer over links  that
introduce  considerable delay, it is not uncommon for packets to incur
an one to two second delay.  The net result is  a  VERY  slow  running
Kermit  with an effective speed of perhaps 300 to 600 baud rather than
1200 or 2400 baud.   By  making  the  packets  longer,  we  raise  the
effective speed of such a circuit.  The main restriction on the packet
size chosen is the link, a given circuit may not  pass  500  character
packets.   Also,  BOTH  Kermits  must  support  this  extension to the
protocol, they will always negotiate it before any file transfer.  See
the notes at the end of this document for more information.

                Kermit-11>SET REC PAC 50
                Kermit-11>SET REC PAC 600

It is HIGHLY recommended that you use the  CRC  block  check,  as  the
default  type  one checksum could be inadequate for such long packets,
as in:

                Kermit-11>SET BLO 3


SET RECORD-FORMAT

Kermit will, by default, create RMS11 variable length implied carriage
control  records  for text files.  You can override this and change it
to create stream ascii  records  with  the  SET  RECORD-FORMAT  STREAM
command.   This  is  useful  for  RSTS/E  systems  if  you  need  file
compatability with BASIC Plus.

                Kermit-11>SET RECORD-FORMAT STREAM
                Kermit-11>SET RECORD-FORMAT VARIABLE

This command would be most useful  in  a  KERMIT.INI  file,  which  is
executed by KERMIT when Kermit starts.

SET RETRY

SET RETRY value tells Kermit to try that many times on a NAK'ed packet
before giving up.  This should only be needed if the line is extremely
noisy or the PDP-11 host is running very  slowly  due  to  the  system
load.

The SET COMMAND



                Kermit-11>SET RETRY 10


SET RSX

The SET RSX command is intended to deal with the  peculiarities  often
found  with  RSX systems.  There are currently three SET RSX commands,
as in:

        Kermit-11>SET RSX FASTIO        Default for packet reading,
                                        waits for <CR>.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX CHARIO        Read one char at a time for
                                        packet reading.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX TC.DLU n      Alters  the TC.DLU setting.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX CONNECT ALT   Uses a new  (v2.33) connect
                                        driver which bypasses TTDRV
                                        flow control.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX CONNECT DEF   Use old connect code (2.32)

The SET RSX command is subject to change and the above options may  be
removed in the future.  Note the the SET RSX CHARIO may be needed when
transfering files with parity enabled.  This command alters the method
by  which  a packet is read; instead of waiting for a carriage return,
Kermit reads the typeahead byte count and then issues a read for  that
many  characters.  This is the same method Kermit-11 ALWAYS uses under
P/OS.

SET RT-11

SET RT-11 CREATE-SIZE

The SET RT-11 CREATE value command was added  to  assist  those  RT-11
users with very small disks to be able to get files with sizes greater
that half of the available contiguous space available.  While this  is
NOT  a problem going from one Kermit-11 to another Kermit-11 since the
PDP-11 Kermit supports a subset of the protocol known as 'ATTRIBUTES',
other  Kermits  may  not  support  the exchange of file sizes (most do
not).  Thus if your largest contiguous space is  300  blocks  and  you
want to get a 250 block file, the command:

        Kermit-11>SET RT-11 CRE 250

would be needed, as RT-11 by default only allocates 50 percent of  the
available space.

SET RT-11 FLOW-CONTROL

Note that for the connect command under RT-11  you  will  most  likely
need  xon/off  flow  control  to  be  generated by Kermit-11.  This is
enabled with the SET RT-11 FLOW command.  This is  by  default  NOFLOW
since  the modem the author uses, a Vadic 212PA, can't handle XONs and
XOFFs while in command mode.  The solution here is to escape  back  to
Kermit  command mode after the remote system has been logged into, and

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-30
The SET COMMAND


then type SET RT-11 FLOW.
The effect of SET RT-11 FLOW is for Kermit-11, when in  connect  mode,
to  send an XOFF to the host every eight characters.  When the loop in
the connect module finds no more data in the input buffer, it sends up
to  2  XON  characters  (in  case  the first XON got lost) to tell the
remote system to start sending again.  The reason for doing so is that
the  RT-11 multiple terminal service is very slow about handling input
interrupts and does not do any of it's  own  flow  control  when  it's
internal  ring  buffer gets full.  This has been tested at line speeds
up to 4800 baud without losing  data.   This  setting  should  not  be
needed for use with the XC/XL handlers.
SET RT-11 FLOW has NO effect on packet transmission, since the  Kermit
packet  size  is  never  mode  than 96 characters, and the RT-11 input
buffer is 134 characters in size.

                Kermit-11>SET RT-11 FLOW
                Kermit-11>SET RT-11 NOFLOW

The  SET  RT-11  [NO]FLOW  command  replaces  the  older  SET   RTFLOW
[ON][OFF].

SET RT-11 VOLUME-VERIFY

Normally RT-11 Kermit-11 will check the directory header of a disk  to
verify  that  it  most  likely  contains  a valid RT-11 file structure
before trying to read the directory.  If for  some  reason  your  disk
does  not  contain  the  standard  data  at  offset 760 in the header,
Kermit-11 will reject the disk.  The  SET  RT-11  NOVOL  command  will
instruct Kermit-11 to bypass that check.

                Kermit-11>SET RT-11 VOL
                Kermit-11>SET RT-11 NOVOL


SET SEND

The SET SEND  command  controls  what  Kermit-11  will  be  doing  for
outgoing  packets  in that you may want to alter the packet terminator
and/or the start of packet character (by default, 15 octal and 1 octal
respectively.  See HELP SET RECEIVE for more information.

The only extra option for SET  SEND  is  SET  SEND  [NO]XON.   If  the
command  SET SEND XON is give, then every packet sent will be prefixed
with an XON character.  This could be useful in situations where  flow
control  is  erratic.   The actual intent of this option was to try to
circumvent a firmware bug in the DHV11 when used under RSTS/E.

SET SPEED

SET SPEED value sets the line speed for the device specified  via  the
SET  LINE  command,  and  used  for the CONNECT command.  Changing the
speed of a terminal line requires privilege for RSTS  and  RSX-11M/M+.
The  SET  SPEED command will only function with a DH11, DHV11, DZ11 or
DZV11 multiline interface.

                Kermit-11>SET SPEED 1200

1200 Baud would be a normal speed to use with a VA212PA or a DF03.

Please note that Kermit-11 CAN NOT change the speed  of  a  DL11  type
interface, nor can it change the speed of a PDT-150 modem port.  For a
PDT-150 modem port, use a command of /M/S:nnnn.  to change  the  speed
to nnnn for the SPEED.SAV program.

SET TIMEOUT

The timeout value tells Kermit how long to wait to get a  packet  from
the  other  Kermit.   If system loads are high, it may be desirable to
increase this beyond the default of 10 seconds.

SET TERMINAL

The SET TERMINAL command  simply  controls  the  way  which  Kermit-11
prints  packet  counts  while  send  or  receiving a file (or group of
files).  The simplest way is the default, SET TER TTY.  Using SET  TER
VT100 will cause Kermit to display headers for the numbers printed, at
a possible cost in packet speed due to screen  control  overhead.   On
the  PRO/350,  VT100  is  assumed.   On  RSTS/E  v9.0  and  later, the
executive is queried for the terminal type.

                Kermit-11>SET TER TTY
                Kermit-11>SET TER VT100


SET UPDATE

The SET UPDATE command controls the  frequency  at  which  the  packet
count  display  is updated.  The default is 1, displaying each packet.
A SET UPD 0 will disable all packet count logs, whereas a  SET  UPD  N
will  update the display every N packets.  The SET NOUPDATE command is
the same as SET UPDATE 0.


The DIAL command


The DIAL command is new for  version  3.29  of  Kermit-11.   The  DIAL
command  is  used  to dial a number on an attached modem of known type
(see SET MODEM).  To find out the current known modems,  use  the  SET
MODEM  ?   command.   The  following example shows a RACAL-VADIC VA212
modem connect to the XK:  port on a PRO/350 running P/OS version 2.

Notes regarding options for the System Manager


                            Odds and ends

There are a few odds and ends that should be made aware to the  system
manager  of  any  PDP-11  system  regarding  Kermit-11.   They  are as
follows, grouped by operating system.  Please note  that  installation
instructions  are in K11INS.DOC and that additional information may be
in Kermit-11's online help command.


RESTRICTIONS

Prior to version 2.21, Kermit-11 did not support 8-bit prefixing.
Prior to version 2.23, Kermit-11  did  not  support  repeat  character
encoding.
 The PRO/RT-11 version of Kermit-11 will request 8-bit  prefixing  due
to  the fact that the XC handler does not support 8BIT data.  For most
Kermits this should not be a problem.  The XC  handler  always  strips
bit  7  from  the  character  being  sent, so the PRO/RT-11 version of
Kermit will request prefixing of  such.   It  does  so  internally  by
setting PARITY to SPACE (always clear the high bit, bit seven).
 Note that this implies that a SET PARITY  SPACE  command  will  force
Kermit-11  to  request  '8bit'  prefixing  in order to transfer binary
files across a seven bit link.

P/OS

Kermit-11 will run on under P/OS on the Pro/350, the  executable  file
is  called K11POS.TSK.  It does NOT run from a menu, the normal way to
run it is via the RUN command in DCL.  It will support  the  Kermit-11
attribute  packets,  thus  a  PRO/350  connected  to a PDP-11 host can
transparently handle binary  and  other  types  of  files.   The  P/OS
Kermit-11  can  be  run  either  as a local Kermit or a Kermit server.
This has been  tested  under  P/OS  version  2  connected  to  both  a
PDP-11/23+ and PDP-11/70 RSTS/E host.

When Kermit-11 is started on the PRO, it will automatically do  a  SET
LINE XK0:  and a SET SPEED 9600.  You can, of course, change the speed
to whatever you need with the SET SPEED command.  The line  should  be
left as XK0:.

The top row function keys are mapped internally.   Kermit-11  maps  F5
(break)  into  a  true  break  (a  space of 275 ms), F6 (interrupt) to
control C, F10 to control Z, F11 to  escape  (octal  33)  and  F12  to
backspace   (octal   10).   The  incoming  escape  sequence  DECID  is
intercepted to allow Kermit-11 to  send  back  a  device  response  of
VT100.

RSTS

 Kermit-11 runs on version 7.2 or later of  RSTS/E.   Due  to  options
present in version 8, binary file transfers will not be possible under
version 7.2 of RSTS/E.  This is due to the use of 8 bit mode  for  the
terminal  link  to  allow  all characters to be passed.  The so called
'8BIT' terminal setting was new as of version 8.0-06 of RSTS/E.

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-34
Notes regarding options for the System Manager


 Any RSTS/E system running Kermit-11 will need the sysgen  option  for
multiple private delimiters in the terminal driver.  This special mode
is needed since  the  'normal'  RSTS/E  binary  terminal  mode  has  a
'feature' that disables binary mode whenever the terminal times out on
a read.  Since timeouts are essential to Kermit error recovery, binary
mode can not be used for i/o.

 Certain functions  of  Kermit-11  require  that  the  system  manager
install  Kermit  with  temporary  privileges,  these  commands are the
SYSTEM, WHO and REMOTE HOST commands.  Kermit-11 does NOT  need  these
to operate correctly.

 Kermit-11 can only be built (from source, not from HEX  files)  under
RSTS/E  version  8.0  or  later  due  to the use of RMS11 v2.0 and new
assembler directives.

 Support for the server remote login is only  available  under  RSTS/E
9.0  or  later.   Also, a REMOTE LOGIN command to a RSTS/E server will
fail unless the user has the WACNT privilege.  While the LOGIN program
will skip the password lookup if WACNT is present, Kermit will require
a password.

RSX-11M/M+

 Kermit-11 can not be installed non-checkpointable due to an  apparent
RMS11 bug.  In other words, don't try to install the task '/CKP=NO'.

 To use the connect command effectively, typeahead support  is  needed
in  the  terminal driver.  For RSX-11M+, set the typeahead buffer size
high, as in SET /TYPEAHEAD=TT22:200.  Also, if your  connect  line  is
TT22:  (as above), use the mcr command SET/SLAVE=TT22:

 Kermit-11 can only be built under RSX-11M version 4.1  or  later,  or
under  RSX-11M  Plus version 2.1 or later due to the use of RMS11 v2.0
and new assembler directives.

 There is a SET RSX command, see HELP SET RSX for further information.

 As a side issue, please note that the file K11POS.TSK is quite usable
under RSX, the difference being that K11RSX.TSK has DECNET support and
RMS-11 overlayed in the task image (besides which,  due  to  the  lack
author's  systems  running  RSX may not be up to date) linked into it,
whereas K11POS has NO Decnet  support  but  IS  linked  to  the  RMS11
library  RMSRES  (v2),  thus  K11POS  saves  disk  space  as  well  as
supporting named directories, ala VMS style.

RT-11

 Kermit-11, as of version 2.20, has been tested  under  RT-11  version
5.0  under  the FB and XM monitors using a DZ11 line for the link, and
also on a  PDT-150  using  the  modem  port  for  the  link.   It  has
additionally  been  run  under Micro-11's and the PRO/350 using the XL
and XC handlers respectively.

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-35
Notes regarding options for the System Manager


 Kermit-11 requires  .TWAIT  support  as  well  as  multiple  terminal
support  (unless  the  XL/XC  handler  is  used).  The use of multiple
terminal support  allows  Kermit-11  to  use  any  type  of  interface
sysgened,  including the DZ11 and DZV11.  It is possible under version
5 of RT-11 to use the XL:  handler instead of  the  multiple  terminal
support.   The  use of the XL:  driver will result in much faster file
transfer at high baud rates.  Note that XL:  must be set up at  system
startup or at some time later to set the proper speed, CSR and vector.

For those users who do not have multiple terminal support and  do  not
have  the  XL handler, Kermit-11 will force the use of the console for
data transfers.  This will require that Kermit-11  request  eight  bit
prefixing  from  any  other  Kermit wishing to send binary data files.
Additionally, you can force console mode by doing a SET LINE TT:

Please note that the device name syntax for terminal lines follows the
MT unit numbers, thus if a SHO TER gave unit 5 for DZ11 line 0 the the
device name would be:

        Kermit-11>SET LINE 5

If you use the XL handler, you would do this:

        Kermit-11>SET LINE XL:

To force the console to be used, you would:

        Kermit-11>SET LINE TT:

Additionally, Kermit-11 for RT-11 looks for its help file, K11HLP.HLP,
on DK:  first and then on SY:  if the first one fails.

 Full wildcarding is supported for RT-11, in the form *.type,  name.*,
*.* and the % character to match any single character.

 Kermit-11 can only be built on RT-11 version 5.0 or later due to  the
use of new assembler directives.

 Please note that for the connect command under RT-11 and the  use  of
the  MT  service, you will most likely need xon/off flow control to be
generated by Kermit-11.  This  is  enabled  with  the  SET  RTFLOW  ON
command.   This  is  by default OFF since the modem the author uses, a
Vadic 212P, can't handle XONs and XOFFs while in  command  mode.   The
solution  here  is  to  escape  back  to Kermit command mode after the
remote system has been logged into, and then type SET RTFLOW ON.

 Due to overlaying constraints, the RT-11 Kermit-11  will  not  accept
wildcards  for  the  RENAME  and DELETE commands and the REMOTE server
equivalents.

 The executable files are K11XM.SAV for the XM system and PRO/350, and
K11RT4 for the FB system.

 As a final (I hope) RT-11 note, see the RT-11 v5.1 Release Notes page

Notes regarding options for the System Manager


9-2  and  chapter 12.  The discussion relevant here regards the use of
the XL/XC handlers.
 Note that the default XL:  handler vector (DL-11, DLV-11) is 300  and
the  CSR  is  176500.   For  the Micro-11, PDP-11 and LSI-11, when the
DL11/DLV11 interface is installed  the  field  service  representative
will  inform  you what the CSR and VECTOR are.  If they are NOT 176500
and 300, then to use the XL:  handler you will need, prior to  running
Kermit-11,  to  set them.  Suppose the DL vector is 400 and the CSR is
176510.  Then the following DCL commands would set the  addresses  for
RT-11.

        .SET XL CSR=176510
        .SET XL VECTOR=400

 You SHOULD NOT ever alter these settings for  XC:   on  the  PRO/3xx.
The  ONLY  settings  you can alter for the PRO/3xx is the speed, as in
DCL command SET XC SPEED=nnnn.  Kermit-11 CAN NOT alter the XC:  speed
itself.   As noted previously in this document, Kermit-11 executes the
Kermit-11 command SET LIN XC:  implicitly if it finds  itself  running
on a PRO/3xx system.

 Note that if your modem requires DTR to  be  present,  you  must  use
either  an  interface  that  asserts  it  (as  does  the  PDT  and PRO
communications port), force it high internally to the modem, or  build
a cable to force it high.  See HELP MODEM for more information.

TSX+

While most of the above notes for RT-11 apply for TSX+,  there  are  a
few  differences  of  note.   The first, in that TSX+ is a timesharing
system, allows the Kermit user to log in normally from another  system
running  Kermit  (as in a Rainbow) and give the TSX+ Kermit the SERVER
command and commence file transfer operations from  the  other  system
(ie, the Rainbow).  If you are dialing INTO a TSX+ system, you need to
give the TSX command:

        .SET TT 8BIT

to be able to transfer data  to  your  local  (PC,  other  PDP-11,...)
system  without incurring the overhead of the Kermit protocol known as
eight bit prefixing.  If this is  not  possible,  due  to  your  local
system requiring parity, or some other intervening device adds parity,
then you should give Kermit the command:

        Kermit-11>SET PARITY SPACE

to let Kermit know that it can't send binary data as-is.

To use Kermit-11 to dial out  from  the  TSX+  system,  the  following
commands are needed.  Note that TSX+ commands will be preceeded by the
normal RT-11 prompt, the ever present  DOT  ('.'),  whereas  Kermit-11
commands   will   be   prefixed   by  the  default  Kermit-11  prompt,
'Kermit-11>'.

        .SET CL LINE=n          Where 'n' is the unit number
        .SET CL NOLFOUT
        .SET CL SPEED=n         Where 'n' is the speed for that unit
        .ASS CL XL              
        Kermit-11>SET LIN XL:
        Kermit-11>CONNECT

As of Kermit-11 version 3.44, you may use CL directly in the SET  LINE
command, as in:

        .SET CL3 LINE=3
        .R K11XM
        Kermit-11>SET LIN CL3
        Kermit-11>SET SPEED 1200
        Kermit-11>CONNECT

A sample command file in actual use is:

        SET CL3 LINE=3
        SET CL3 NOLFOUT
        SET CL3 TAB
        SET CL3 FORM
        SET CL3 SPEED=2400
        ALLOCATE CL3:
        R K11XM
        DEALLOC CL3
        SET CL3 LFOUT
        SET CL3 LINE=0
        SH CL

If you are running PRO/TSX+, then Kermit will make the  assignment  of
LINE  3  to  either  CL0  or  CL1  if  you are running Kermit from the
console, ie, LINE 1.  The speed will default to the last SET SPEED  or
the speed set at system boot.

Lastly, TSX+ needs PLAS support to use K11XM.SAV, see the installation
notes for further data.


Notes regarding modems


RSTS/E version 9.x

RSTS/E does not control modems signals in the manner that RSX  or  VMS
does.  VMS always asserts DTR whereas RSTS/E will not assert DTR until
the terminal driver can see RCD (also known as DCD)  which  is  pin  8
(eight)  for  the  RS232  connection.   To connect directly to a modem
(like a VADIC 212, sorry, no DEC modems here) we must do  one  of  two
things:

(1) Force the modem (via strapping options or whatever) to assert  RCD
(DCD)  pin  8,  thus RSTS/E will see carrier and raise DTR (pin 20 for
RS232)

PDP-11 KERMIT                                                Page 1-38
MODEMS


(2)  Set  the  terminal  to  LOCAL  (RSTS/E   V9   syntax   'SET   TER
TTxx:/NODIAL/PERM')  and break pin 20 (DTR) and connect pin 20 to 8 on
the modem side.  This will cause the modem to be able to dial out  and
allow  RSTS/E  to connect to it.  You will also need to have the modem
assert RCD, pin 8.  Keep in mind that the Kermit-11 command DISCONNECT
(or  HANGUP)  will  not  function if a line is set to NODIAL (INIT SET
syntax 'LOCAL').  This has been tested on a Racal Vadic VA212.

(3) Break pin 8 (RCD) and loop DTR (pin 20) on the  CPU  side  to  RCD
(pin 8) on the CPU side.  Then use the command SET DTR in Kermit-11 to
get RSTS to raise DTR and thus loop it's DTR signal back to RCD.   See
the next note regarding this.


For those of you who have port switches  such  as  the  Gandalf  type,
there is one additional problem.
For Gandalf, suppose you want to connect a DZ11 line to to  an  AMTB2.
You  will  have  a problem, in that the Gandalf AMTB2 wants to see RCD
(DCD) asserted to make a connection.  What you may need to do is this:

        Make a cable for the DZ11 to AMTB2 port as follows:

        CPU side                        AMTB2 side
                        20--|
                        8---|-----------8
                        7---------------7
                        3---------------2
                        2---------------3

        Note that 20 is tied to 8 on the CPU side.
        Also, 2 is swapped for 3.

Then, the Kermit-11 command SET DTR, which forces RSTS  to  raise  DTR
for  30  seconds,  will  cause  the DTR signal to loop back to the RCD
(DCD) signal and thus tell RSTS that there  is  carrier  detect  which
will  raise  DTR (the chicken or egg question) and get things rolling.
The Kermit-11 HANGUP (or DISCONNECT) command will drop DTR  and  force
the modem to break the connection.


RSX and Modems

While the authors experience on RSX is limited,  the  following  notes
may be of use.
Dialing out on a LOCAL line will often require that the  modem  assert
internally DTR.
If a line is set REMOTE on RSX, the driver will assert  DTR  and  RTS.
For  a  modem,  like a VA212PAR strapped at the factory defaults, this
will cause the  modem  to  assert  DSR  and  RCD.   On  the  VADIC  in
particular,  the  modem will drop RCD during a DIAL command unless the
modem is configured to assert  RCD  continuously.   For  dialing  out,
ideally  the  modem  should  be  able  to  assert RCD via an option or
internally settable strap or switch.  If  this  is  not  possible,  an
alternative is to break line 8 (RCD) and jumper DTR (20) to RCD (8) on

MODEMS


the CPU side.  This will force RSX to always see  carrier  detect  and
allow  a  dial sequence to complete.  The Kermit-11 command DISCONNECT
(or HANGUP) will still disconnect the modem as  the  modem  will  drop
from  the  line  when  it  sees  DTR go low (assuming the modem is not
strapped to assert DTR internally).

Typical Kermit-11 transfer rates


Some sample timings for Kermit-11 and long packet support.  The packet
size  in  the  RSTS/E  to  P/OS was 500 bytes, the size from RSTS/E to
RSTS/E was 700 bytes.  These sizes are somewhat arbitrary, they depend
more on the system's buffering capabilities than anything else.

Host buffering capabilities:

P/OS                    500 (estimated)
RSTS/E 9.0 or later     up to 7000, given sufficient system pool
RSX-11M+                        255 (I/D space CPU only)
RSX-11M                 34
RT-11                   134 (could be larger with mod to XC/XL)

As it can be seen, large packets make sense only for RSTS/E, P/OS  and
RSX-11M+  if one wishes to avoid XON/XOFF overhead at high speeds.  It
should be possible to run larger packets on  M+  and  RT-11  at  lower
speeds.

                                connected locally via Gandalf switch.

The last two timings are much lower than the line  speed  due  to  the
fact  the  the  PDP  11/44 is running 100% busy trying to keep up with
character interrupts  using  a  normal  terminal  driver.   A  special
purpose  driver, such as the XK driver found on P/OS, would have lower
overhead and allow somewhat faster data rates.

Long packets were chosen for Kermit-11 due to  the  lack  of  suitable
interrupt  driven  i/o  (at  this  time)  under  one  of the operating
systems, RSTS/E.  The Sliding Windows would likely function better  in
those  situations  where the circuit delay is much higher, or when the
circuit can not accommodate large packet sizes.

Common problems


                   Common problems in file transfer


Connection fails.

Check modem control signals.  RSX needs TC.DLU set to two to talk to a
dial  out modem, otherwise you will need to strap or jumper signals in
the modem to have carrier detect set high.  RSTS/E  also  should  have
the modem assert carrier detect.  If not, see the previous notes about
modems.  If all else fails, put a breakout box in the line and observe
what signals are present.

File transfer fails.

If the file transfer aborts on retries immediately,  there  may  be  a
parity  problem.   If  the problem shows up on binary files, try a SET
PAR SPACE command to Kermit; that will force  eight  bit  data  to  be
prefixed into seven bits.  If you instead get a retry about once every
10 seconds, the other Kermit is not  responding  and  your  Kermit  is
timing out.  Check to see if your connection is still present, and try
the SET PARITY command.
If you are sending binary data between unlike Kermits, you  will  most
likely have to give the proper command to each to prepare them for the
binary data; this is the SET FILE command; for Kermit-11 it's SET  FIL
BIN (or SET FIL TYP FIX); for VMS Kermit it's SET FIL TYP FIX.
If your Kermit's packets are being echoed back, try a SET  SEND  START
value  command  for your Kermit, and a SET REC START samevalue for the
other Kermit.  This will force Kermit to ignore any echoed packets  as
they  won't  have  the default start of packet character (a CONTROL A,
octal 1).
