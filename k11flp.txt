As submitted to Decus, Kermit-11 is on one of three types of media:

1. 16MT9 DOS format tape, full kit, read by FLX on RSX and PIP on RSTS/E
2.  3  RX01  RT11 format disks, read by COPY on RT11, FLX on RSX and FIT
on RSTS/E 
3. 2 RX50 disks, one P/OS format for use on  P/OS,  RSX  and  Micro/RSX,
and the other RT11 format for reading under RT11, RSTS/E (with FIT). 


The floppy disk kits do NOT include any source files.  The  installation
notes,  K11INS.DOC,  do  not contain any references to specific media or
ways to transfer files from a specific type of media. See notes  at  the
end of this file for information. 


For the RX01 disks, the files are:

	1/3		K11.TSK, K11RT4.SAV, K11XM.SAV
	2/3		K11POS.TSK, K11RSX.TSK
	3/3		K11NRS.TSK, K11HLP.HLP, K11INS.DOC and K11FLP.DOC.

For the RX50 disks, the files are:

	1/2 RT11 format	K11POS.TSK, K11.TSK, K11RT4.SAV, K11XM.SAV, K11HLP.HLP
			K11INS.DOC
	2/2 P/OS format	K11RSX.TSK, K11POS.TSK, K11XM.SAV, K11HLP.HLP
			K11INS.DOC


P/OS disks are readable under MicroRSX, the files  are  in  directory  [KERMIT].
RT11 format disks can be read with FLX on RSX and FIT on RSTS/E. 

The best way to make copies of the diskettes is  to  use  the  COPY/DEV  command
under  RT11  and  PRO/RT11. This does a physical copy of the entire disk without
regard for the internal file structure or data  on  the  diskettes.  Of  course,
copying disks under P/OS from the menu is only possible for P/OS format disks. 

Note  the  K11POS.TSK  will run under RSX11M/M+, the only difference from K11RSX
is (1) NO DAP support and (2) the task is linked to RMSRES. 

In all cases, please read K11INS.DOC for more information.

In all cases DZn: refers to DZ drive unit N

RSX, RSXM+ and Micro-RSX

	If you have the segmented RMSRES from M+ or Micro-RSX
	then
	  (1) Copy DZn:[1,2]K11POS.TSK to [1,54]KERMIT.TSK
	else
	  (1) Copy DZn:[1,2]K11RSX.TSK to [1,54]KERMIT.TSK
	
	(2) Copy DZn:[1,2]K11HLP.HLP to [1,2]
	(3) Copy and print K11USR.DOC
	(4) Set protection on the files
	(5) Do INS $KERMIT/TASK=...KER


RT11 and TSX+

	If you are using the XM (RT11) monitor or TSX with PLAS
	then
	  (1) Copy K11XM.SAV to KERMIT.SAV
	else
	  (1) Copy K11RT4.SAV to KERMIT.SAV
	
	(2) Copy K11HLP.HLP to SY:
	(3) Copy K11USR.DOC and print it


RSTS/E

	Use [1,2]FIT.TSK to copy K11.TSK to [1,2]KERMIT.TSK/PR:104/MO:16
	Use [1,2]FIT.TSK to copy K11HLP.HLP to [1,2]K11HLP.HLP/MO:16/PR:40
	Use [1,2]FIT.TSK to copy K11USR.DOC and print it
	Do the DCL command DEF/COM/SYS KER-MIT [1,2]KERMIT.TSK/LIN=30000
	and place that command in [0,1]START.COM
