1 @

 This command opens  an  indirect  file  for  command  input.   It  is
 identical to the TAKE command.  The format of the command is:

                Kermit-11>@ file-specification

 where 'file-specification' is any valid  file  specification  on  the
 system on which the server Kermit is running.

1 BINARY FILES

  Binary files are those files which require all eight  bits  in  each
 character.   Text  files, like program source files, compiler listing
 and RUNOFF files, normally use  only  the  low  seven  bits  in  each
 character.   Binary  files  include  task  images,  save  images, RMS
 relative and indexed files and other special types of files.
  In order for Kermit to transfer these files Kermit-11 needs an eight
 bit   line,   which   for   most   PDP-11  systems  is  the  default.
 Additionally, most Kermits need to be  set  into  a  binary  mode  to
 transfer  such  files.   The  command  to do this is usually the 'SET
 FILETYPE BINARY' command, or 'SET FIL BIN' for short.  Since  various
 Kermit  implementations are at different stages of developement, most
 Kermit links can NOT handle  binary  files  automatically,  thus  the
 above  SET  command  must  be given to BOTH Kermits prior to a binary
 file transfer.  One important note is that the VMS Kermit-32 requires
 a  SET  FIL  TYP  FIX to properly send and receive binary files.  For
 example, a Kermit-11 connected to a VMS  system  as  a  local  Kermit
 would  first  log  onto  the  VAX  and  invoke Kermit-32 and give the
 commands SET FIL TYP FIX and SER.  Then one would escape back to  the
 Kermit-11  (control c) and give Kermit-11 the command SET FIL BIN (or
 the same, SET FIL TYP FIX).  At this point the Kermit-11 can use  the
 GET  and  SEND commands to transfer binary files like task images and
 save images.
  As a side note, there may be cases where  the  proper  SET  commands
 have  been  given  but  the  binary file does not transfer correctly.
 This has been noted on VMS when a task image is copied from tape  via
 FLX  to  disk  and then sent over to a PDP-11 using Kermit.  The file
 was found to contain carriage  control  after  it  was  sent  to  the
 PDP-11.   This  was  because when FLX created it on the VAX, the file
 was created with fixed 512 records with carriage return control.  VMS
 Kermit honored this and sent a CRLF every 512 bytes.
  Please note that transfering text files when  one  or  both  of  the
 Kermits  are  set to binary mode can result in an unusable file after
 transfer because of the possibility of  transfering  imbedded  record
 control information.

  Version 2.16 (and later versions) of Kermit-11, however, can do  the
 switch  into  binary  mode  automatically if the file attributes (and
 protection code for RSTS/E) indicate that the file is most  likely  a
 binary  file.   Additionally, two Kermit-11's connected to each other
 will both do the 'right' thing if this is the  case  by  the  sending
 Kermit-11  telling  the receiving Kermit-11 to switch to binary mode.
 In this case, the sending Kermit-11 will also send a copy of the file
 attributes over so the receiving Kermit-11 can properly set this when
 the file is closed.  Thus two Kermit-11's connected to each other can
 send task images, RMS indexed files and so on.

1 BYE

 The BYE command will cause Kermit-11 (when in local mode) to tell the
 other Kermit (which should be in server mode) to exit from Kermit and
 if applicable terminate its job (or process, etc.).   When  Kermit-11
 receives  the acknowledgement that this is being done, it will prompt
 for another command.  The DISCONNECT command should always follow the
 BYE command.  The format for BYE is:

                Kermit-11>BYE


1 COMMAND-LINE

 Kermit, if the task is installed on RSX11M/M+ or has a CCL  name  for
 it for RSTS/E, can get a command from the command-line and execute it
 immediately.  For all commands other than SERVER,  Kermit  will  exit
 upon  completion  of the command.  In the case of the SERVER command,
 Kermit will return to interactive mode if the local Kermit sends it a
 FINISH command.

                > KERMIT SERVER
                $ KERMIT HELP

1 CONNECT

 The CONNECT command will  allow  you  to  connect  in  as  a  virtual
 terminal  over  the  line that was specified by the SET LINE command.
 (Using the CONNECT command before using the  SET  LINE  command  will
 result  in  an error message.) The terminal line must be one which is
 accessable to the user.  The format of the CONNECT command is:

                Kermit-11>CONNECT

 The distributed RSX11M/M+ task has been built with the  /PR:0  switch
 to  enable  the task to change other terminal settings.  Addtionally,
 for RSX11M/M+, the MCR  command  SET  /SLAVE=TTnn:   should  be  done
 before entering Kermit-11.

 If you are running K11POS.TSK on a PRO/350, Kermit will set the  line
 to XK0:  and the speed to 9600 by default.

 Please note that Kermit-11 CANNOT change the speed  of  a  DL11  type
 interface,  nor  can it change the speed of a PDT-150 modem port (use
 SPEED.SAV).

 The following is an example of using a Racal-Vadic VA212  autodialing
 modem  to  log into a remote TOPS-20 system.  There are two points at
 which there is no echoing of the user input.  The first is the typing
 of a control-E <cr> sequence to get the attention of the modem, which
 responds by sending the string 'HELLO:I'M READY'.  The second is  the
 typing  of the local 'escape sequence', which by default is control \
 followed by a  'C'.   The  control  backslash  informs  the  terminal
 emulator  that  the  next  character is a command.  In this case, the
 command was 'C', which means to return to the  local  PDP-11  system.
 Control \ ?  would print a help message.

1 COPY

 The COPY command creates a copy of the  input  file.   The  Kermit-11
 COPY  command  does  NOT support wildcards in the filename, and while
 COPY does use multiblock buffering it is usually  more  efficient  to
 use  the  system  utilty  PIP or the DCL command COPY for this.  COPY
 uses RMS block i/o for both RSTS and RSX.  Any executable  RSTS  file
 (*.TSK,  *.BAC  and  *.SAV) copied will not be useable until it's run
 time system name and protection code is reset.

                Kermit-11> COPY
                From: ABCDEF.DAT
                To  : FUBAR.LST

        or

                Kermit-11> COPY ABCDEF.DAT FUBAR.LST


1 CWD

 The CWD command alters the current  device  and  UIC  (PPN)  default.
 Thus,  the  command  'CWD  [200,200]'  would cause all following file
 operations  to  insert  the  string  [200,200]  unless  an   explicit
 directory  name was given.  This is identical to the SET DEF command.
 Passwords are ignored.

1 DECNET

 Kermit-11 can access DECnet files if built with DAP support.  This is
 included in the task images K11NRS.TSK and K11RSX.TSK as distributed.
 DECnet support has been tested for RSX11M.  See SET DEFAULT for  more
 information.

1 DELETE

 The DELETE command will delete the specified file or file group  from
 the system.  Wildcards are permitted.

                Kermit-11>DELETE FUBAR.MAC
                Kermit-11>DELETE FUBAR.*


1 DIAL

 The DIAL command will take the number specified and  attempt  to  get
 the  attached  modem to dial the phone number.  The SET MODEM command
 must  have  be  used  first,  except  in   the   case   of   PRO/TMS.
 Additionally,  if  no line has been set, the SET LINE command must be
 used.  Note that for the PRO/350, an implicit  SET  LINE  command  is
 done at startup for XK:  or XC:.
 Once a connection is made, you will  be  returned  to  the  Kermit-11
 command line prompt, at which time you can use the CONNECT command to
 attach to the remote system.
 The case of PRO/TMS is special.  This is an internal modem,  accessed
 via  device  XT1:.   In  this case, the user MUST suplly, in the dial
 string, any TMS formatting or control characters.  The modem type  is
 selected automatically if you do a SET LINE XT0:  or SET LINE XT1:

1 DIRECT

 The DIRECT command will display the current  default  directory  when
 used in the format:

                Kermit-11>DIRECT

 If a directory other than the current default  directory  is  desired
 then DIRECT may be used in the format:

                Kermit-11>DIRECT file-specification

 where 'file-specification' is any legitimate  combination  of  device
 name,  UIC  or  PPN,  and  a  filename which can include wild-carding
 characters.

1 DISCONNECT

 The DISCONNECT command causes Kermit-11 to 'hang-up' the  line  which
 was  specified  with  the  SET  LINE  command  and connected with the
 CONNECT command.  The format is:

                Kermit-11>DISCONNECT


1 DISPLAY

 The Display command will format and  print  global  read/write  data,
 defined in K11MAC.MAC, to the terminal, as in:

                Kermit-11>DISP PROMPT


1 ERASE

 The ERASE command will ERASE the specified file or  file  group  from
 the system.  Wildcards are permitted.

                Kermit-11>ERASE FUBAR.MAC
                Kermit-11>ERASE FUBAR.*

 The ERASE command is identical to the DELETE command.

1 EXIT

 The EXIT command will cause Kermit to return to  the  command  level.
 This command is the same as the QUIT command.  The format is:

                Kermit-11>EXIT


1 FINISH

 The FINISH command will tell Kermit-11, which is in  local  mode,  to
 signal the other Kermit to exit from server mode.  When Kermit-11 has
 received acknowledgement that this is being done, it will prompt  for
 another command.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>FINISH


1 GET

 The GET command tells the remote Kermit which is in  server  mode  to
 get a file or group of files.  The format for this command is:


                Kermit-11>GET file-specification

 where 'file-specification' may include any legitimate device, PPN  or
 UIC  as  well  as the file specification.  Wildcarding may be used in
 the file-spec.  to obtain a group of files.

1 HANGUP

 The HANGUP command will drop the remote line  specified  by  the  SET
 LINE  command  and  connected  by  the CONNECT command.  This command
 presumes that the modem cable has the DTR line  (pin  20)  connected.
 The same function is performed by the DISCONNECT command.  The format
 of the HANGUP command is:

                Kermit-11>HANGUP


1 HELP-FILE

 The Kermit-11 help file (this file) should be located as follows:

        For RSTS/E, RSX11M/M+

                LB:[1,2]K11HLP.HLP      or
                SY:[1,2]K11HLP.HLP      or
                KERMIT:K11HLP.HLP       or

        For P/OS on the PRO/350

                [001002]K11HLP.HLP


1 HOST

 The HOST command is identical to the SYSTEM command in that it  takes
 the command and spawns a process to execute the command.

                Kermit-11>HOST SHO TER

1 INTRODUCTION

 The  KERMIT  file  transfer  protocol  is  intended  for  use  in  an
 environment  where  there  may  be  a diverse mixture of computers --
 micros,  personal  computers,  workstations,  laboratory   computers,
 timesharing  systems  --  from a variety of manufacturers.  All these
 systems need have in common is the ability to  communicate  in  ASCII
 over ordinary serial telecommunication lines.

 KERMIT was originally designed at Columbia  University  to  meet  the
 need  for  file  transfer between our DECSYSTEM-20 and IBM 370-series
 mainframes and  various  microcomputers.   It  turned  out  that  the
 diverse characteristics of these three kinds of systems resulted in a
 design that was general enough to fit almost  any  system.   The  IBM
 mainframe,  in  particular, strains most common assumptions about how
 computers communicate.

 The KERMIT protocol is specifically designed  for  character-oriented
 transmission  over serial telecommunication lines.  The design allows
 for  the  restrictions  and  peculiarities  of  the  medium  and  the
 requirements  of diverse operating environments -- buffering, duplex,
 parity, character set,  file  organization,  etc.   The  protocol  is
 carried  out  by KERMIT programs on each end of the serial connection
 sending "packets" back and forth; the sender sends file  names,  file
 contents,   and   control   information;  the  receiver  acknowledges
 (positively or negatively) each packet.

 The packets have a layered design, in keeping with the ANSI  and  ISO
 philosophies,  with  the outermost fields used by the data link layer
 to verify data integrity, the next by the  session  layer  to  verify
 continuity, and the data itself at the application level.

 Connections between systems are established by the ordinary user.  In
 a  typical  case,  the  user  runs  KERMIT on a microcomputer, enters
 terminal emulation, connects to a remote host  computer  (perhaps  by
 dialing up), logs in, runs KERMIT on the remote host, and then issues
 commands to that KERMIT to start a file transfer, "escapes"  back  to
 the  micro,  and  issues commands to that KERMIT to start its side of
 the file transfer.  Files may be transferred singly or in groups.

 Basic KERMIT provides only file transfer, and that  is  provided  for
 sequential  files  only,  though  the  protocol attempts to allow for
 various types of sequential files.  Microcomputer implementations  of
 KERMIT are also expected to provide terminal emulation, to facilitate
 the initial connection.

 More advanced implementations simplify the user interface somewhat by
 allowing  the  KERMIT  on the remote host to run as a "server", which
 can transfer files in either direction upon command  from  the  local
 "user" Kermit.  The server can also provide additional functionality,
 such as  file  management,  messages,  mail,  and  so  forth.   Other
 optional  features  also  exist,  including  a variety of block check
 types,  a  mechanism  for  passing  8-bit  data   through   a   7-bit
 communication  link,  a  way  to  compressing  a repeated sequence of
 characters, and so forth.

 As  local  area  networks  become  more  popular,  inexpensive,   and
 standardized,  the  demand  for  KERMIT  and  similar  protocols  may
 dwindle, but will  never  wither  away  entirely.   Unlike  hardwired
 networks,  KERMIT  gives  the  ordinary  user  the power to establish
 reliable error-free connections between any two computers;  this  may
 always be necessary for one-shot or long-haul connections.

1 LOCAL

 The LOCAL command can be used to prefix any Kermit command to  insure
 that  the  command  so prefixed will be carried out by the user's own
 kermit.  All commands are local by default  with  the  exceptions  of
 BYE, FINISH,and GET.  The LOCAL command format is:

                Kermit-11>LOCAL Kermit-command-name


1 LOGFILE

 The LOGFILE command creates the debug and session logging  file.   It
 is identical to the SET LOGFILE command.

                Kermit-11>LOGFILE FUBAR.LOG


1 Modems

 The question of how to set one's modem (if applicable) depends  on  a
 number  of  factors.   For  this  discusion,  we  will  be limited to
 considerations under RSTS/E (and to a limited degree, RSX and  P/OS).
 This  discussion  is  relavent  to dialing out from an attached line.
 Please note that the following comments will not be applicable to all
 types of modems.
2 RSTS/E

 RSTS/E does not control modems signals in the manner that RSX or  VMS
 does.   VMS  always  asserts  DTR  whereas RSTS/E will not assert DTR
 until the terminal driver can see RCD (also known as  DCD)  which  is
 pin  8  (eight) for the RS232 connection.  If the interface is a DH11
 with full modem control, a cable with all signals connected will work
 fine.   However,  if the interface is a DZ11 we have the problem that
 the DZ has only partial modem control.   To  connect  directly  to  a
 modem (like a VADIC 212, sorry, no DEC modems here) we must do one of
 two things:

 (1) Force the modem (via strapping options or whatever) to assert RCD
 (DCD)  pin  8, thus RSTS/E will see carrier and raise DTR (pin 20 for
 RS232)

 (2)  Set  the  terminal  to  LOCAL  (RSTS/E  V9   syntax   'SET   TER
 TTxx:/NODIAL/PERM') and break pin 20 (DTR) and connect pin 20 to 8 on
 the modem side.  This will cause the modem to be able to dial out and
 allow  RSTS/E to connect to it.  You will also need to have the modem
 assert  RCD,  pin  8.   Keep  in  mind  that  the  Kermit-11  command
 DISCONNECT  (or  HANGUP) will not function if a line is set to NODIAL
 (INIT SET syntax 'LOCAL').  This has been tested  on  a  Racal  Vadic
 VA212.

 For those of you who have port switches such  as  the  Gandalf  type,
 there is one additional problem.
 For Gandalf, suppose you want to connect a DZ11 line to to an  AMTB2.
 You  will  have a problem, in that the Gandalf AMTB2 wants to see RCD
 (DCD) asserted to make a connection.  What you  may  need  to  do  is
 this:

        Make a cable for the DZ11 to AMTB2 port as follows:

        CPU side                        AMTB2 side
                        20--|
                        8---|-----------8
                        7---------------7
                        3---------------2
                        2---------------3

        Note that 20 is tied to 8 on the CPU side.
        Also, 2 is swapped for 3.

 Then, the Kermit-11 command SET DTR, which forces RSTS to  raise  DTR
 for  30  seconds,  will  cause the DTR signal to loop back to the RCD
 (DCD) signal and thus tell RSTS that there is  carrier  detect  which
 will  raise DTR (the chicken or egg question) and get things rolling.
 The Kermit-11 HANGUP (or DISCONNECT) command will drop DTR and  force
 the modem to break the connection.
2 P/OS (Pro 3xx)

 Under P/OS the author has used (1) a DLV11 line in the 11/23+ at home
 at 9600 baud without any modem signals, (2) a link using only 2,3 and
 7 to a Racal Vadic 3212 (not an autodialer) and (3) a Gandalf  LDS125
 modem.   In all cases there were no problems.  It would seem that the
 PRO/350 comm port does not need the modem  signals.   This  will,  of
 course,  mean  that  the  HANGUP  (or  DISCONNECT)  commands will NOT
 function since DTR is not being passed.  Please note  that  you  must
 ensure  that  pins  2  and 3 (RXD and TXD) are swapped if you are not
 using some type of modem (one of the things a NULL modem  cable  does
 ).

2 RSX11M/M+

 The setting of the connected line (SET LINE  TTnn:)  depends  on  the
 signals  that  the modem can assert (see HELP MODEM RSTS).  Since the
 author does not run RSX on a system with modem lines (the  system  is
 an  11/23+,  DLV11  lines), the command SET RSX TC.DLU value has been
 added (though untested).  This command can be used to set the  TC.DLU
 parameter to 1 or 2.  A value of one (1) (SET RSX TC 1) is normal for
 remote  lines,  indeed,  it  is  the  result  of  the   MCR   command
 SET/REMOTE=TTnn:.   However,  it may be the case that TC.DLU needs to
 be set to two (2) (SET RSX TC.DLU 2).  If this SET command  is  used,
 Kermit-11  will  alter it (if different from the current setting) and
 wait five (5) seconds for the change to come into  effect.   This  is
 only  applicable to modem controlled lines.  There is no way (at this
 time) to change the TC.DLU setting to two via  MCR  or  DCL  commands
 (perhaps we need a SET /DIALOUT=TTnn:).

 For more information, please consult K11USR.DOC

1 MicroRSX

 Operation under MicroRSX is identical to that under RSX11M+ and,  for
 the  most part, P/OS.  The image K11POS.TSK is used, as this image is
 linked to the resident library RMSRES, thus allowing access to  named
 directories under MicroRSX.

1 QUIT

 The QUIT command will cause Kermit-11 to return to the command level.
 This command is the same as the EXIT command.  The format is:

                Kermit-11>QUIT


1 PARITY

 Sometimes two Kermit's may appear to be sending the  correct  packets
 but  one or the other of them will constantly reject the same packet.
 This usually will be seen when the requesting Kermit  asks  a  server
 for a file and then rejects the server's first packet, doing so until
 the retry threshold is reached.  This can often be caused  by  parity
 being  introduced  somewhere,  and one or both of the Kermit's do not
 know this.  This can happen when a modem is generating parity or when
 a  private  or  public network is doing so.  Some Kermit's have a SET
 PARITY command to assist in this.   If  the  communications  link  is
 introducing  parity,  a simple fix is to tell each Kermit the command
 SET PARITY SPACE.  This will  force  the  Kermit  program  to  always
 remove  bit  7 from the incoming data.  Normally this will not affect
 file transfer since  many  Kermit  implementations  support  what  is
 called  eight  bit  prefixing, which is a method of encoding an eight
 bit data item to fit over a seven bit link.  See HELP SET PARITY  for
 more information.

1 PRINT

 The PRINT command will cause the specified file(s) to be  printed  on
 the  system  line  printer.   This  command  may  not function on all
 systems.

1 PRO/350

2 RT11 version 5.1

 Kermit-11 runs under the RT11 version 5.1 XM  monitor  by  using  the
 DIGITAL  distributed  XC  handler.   The  XC handler supports several
 useful functions such as start/stop break, variable  size  reads  and
 driver/line  reset.  Due to an apparent bug in the driver, Kermit has
 to use flow control (XON/XOFF) to control the sending Kermit at  high
 speeds  (9600 baud).  This has the undesireable effect of slowing the
 transfer down by about 15 percent.  This is  enabled  by  typing  SET
 RTFLOW ON.
 As an alternative, the XC  handler  can  be  modified  to  avoid  all
 problems  with  buffer  overflows  by  increasing  the buffer size in
 XL.MAC.  See the file K11PRT.MAC for information regarding this.

 Note the the XC handler does not accept .SPFUN calls  to  change  the
 baud  rate, rather, you must set it prior to entering Kermit-11 as in
 SET XC:SPEED=9600.  The Kermit DISCONNECT command will not  function.
 Kermit  will  always fake a SET LINE XC0:  at startup on the PRO/350.
 Unlike the standard RT11 Kermit-11, you DO NOT need to  use  the  SET
 RTFLOW ON command to enforce flow control during the CONNECT command.
 The XC driver handles this automatically for you.
 To send a BREAK  while  in  CONNECT  mode,  type  your  local  escape
 character (normally a CTRL \) followed by a B.

2 P/OS version 2.0

 Kermit-11 will run on under P/OS on the Pro/350, the executable  file
 is  called K11POS.TSK.  It does NOT (and cannot) run from a menu, the
 normal way to run it is via the RUN command in DCL.  It will  support
 the Kermit-11 attribute packets, thus a PRO/350 connected to a PDP-11
 host can transparently handle binary and other types of  files.   The
 P/OS  Kermit-11  can  be  run  either  as  a local Kermit or a Kermit
 server.  This has been tested under P/OS version 2 connected to  both
 a PDP-11/23+ and PDP-11/70 RSTS/E host.
 When Kermit-11 is started on the PRO, it will automatically do a  SET
 LINE  XK0:   and  a  SET  SPEED 9600.  You can, of course, change the
 speed to whatever you need with the  SET  SPEED  command.   The  line
 should be left as XK0:.

1 RECEIVE

 The RECEIVE command will put Kermit-11 into remote mode to wait for a
 single  file  transfer  transaction.   Kermit-11 will wait for a file
 transfer initialization from  the  other  kermit.   This  command  is
 useful  if  the  other Kermit does not support local server commands.
 Command format is:

                Kermit-11>RECEIVE

 Please note that this version  of  Kermit-11  (Version  1)  does  NOT
 support the RECEIVE command in the format:

                Kermit-11>RECEIVE filename


1 REMOTE

 The REMOTE command is used as a prefix to indicate to Kermit-11  that
 the  command  so  prefixed  is  to  be executed by the other (remote)
 Kermit server.  Command format:

                Kermit-11>REMOTE

 will return a prompt requesting a command name:

                Remote Kermit cmd ?

 REMOTE can also be used with a command name as an argument:

                Kermit-11>REMOTE command-name

 Please see HELP REMOTE command name for details and HELP  SERVER  for
 general Kermit server operation.

2 BYE

 The REMOTE BYE command will cause Kermit-11 (when in local  mode)  to
 tell  the  other Kermit (which should be in server mode) to exit from
 Kermit and if applicable terminate its job (or process, etc.).   When
 Kermit-11  receives  the  acknowledgement that this is being done, it
 will prompt for  another  command.   The  DISCONNECT  command  should
 always  follow.   This  command  (REMOTE  BYE) is the same as the BYE
 command.  The command format is:
  
                Kermit-11>REMOTE BYE

 or

                Kermit-11>REMOTE 
                Remote Kermit cmd ?BYE


2 COPY

 The remote copy is just like  the  local  copy  command  in  that  it
 creates  a  copy  of  the  input file.  Like the local Kermit-11 COPY
 command it does NOT support wildcards in the filename, and while COPY
 does use multiblock buffering it is usually more efficient to use the
 system utilty PIP or the DCL command COPY for this.   COPY  uses  RMS
 block  i/o  for  both RSTS and RSX.  Any executable RSTS file (*.TSK,
 *.BAC and *.SAV) copied will not  be  useable  until  it's  run  time
 system name and protection code is reset.

                Kermit-11>REMOTE COPY
                From: ABCDEF.DAT
                To  : FUBAR.LST

        or

                Kermit-11>REMOTE COPY ABCDEF.DAT FUBAR.LST


2 CWD

 The REMOTE CWD command will cause Kermit-11 to  send  to  the  Kermit
 server  the  new  default  directory.   If the server is a Kermit-11,
 passwords are ignored.  See HELP CWD and HELP  SET  DEF  for  further
 information.

2 DIRECT

 The remote DIRECT command will tell the remote Kermit server to  send
 a directory listing over the connection.  Not all Kermit servers have
 this implemented.

                Kermit-11>REM DIR *.MAC

 The above example would tell the remote server to  send  a  directory
 listing of all files ending with a .MAC filetype.

2 ERASE

 The remote ERASE command will tell the remote Kermit server to delete
 any  files  matching the file specification.  For a Kermit-11 server,
 this can include wildcard characters.

                Kermit-11>REM ERASE *.MAC

                Files deleted:
                SY:[2,2]FUBAR.MAC
                SY:[2,2]HLPSUB.MAC

                Kermit-11>

 The remote Kermit server may respond with the filenames deleted,  the
 above example is what a Kermit-11 server would respond with.

2 FINISH

 The REMOTE FINISH command will tell Kermit-11 ,  which  is  in  local
 mode,  to  signal  the  other  Kermit to exit from server mode.  When
 Kermit-11 has received acknowledgement that this  is  being  done  it
 will  prompt  for  another command.  REMOTE FINISH is the same as the
 FINISH command.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>REMOTE FINISH

 or
                Kermit-11>REMOTE
                Remote Kermit cmd ?FINISH


2 GET

 The REMOTE GET command tells the remote Kermit  which  is  in  server
 mode  to get a file or group of files.  REMOTE GET is the same as the
 GET command.  The format for this command is:
  
                Kermit-11>REMOTE GET

 or

                Kermit-11>REMOTE
                Remote Kermit cmd ?GET


2 HELP

 The REMOTE HELP command instructs a remote Kermit server  to  send  a
 list of remote commands that it can process.

2 HOST

 The REMOTE HOST command sends the comamnd over to the  remote  Kermit
 for  execution  on that system.  This is only currently supported for
 version 8.0 of RSTS/E, and will be supported for RSX11M-Plus  in  the
 near future.

                Kermit-11>REM HOST SHO DEV

                Busy Devices:

                Kermit-11>

2 RENAME

 The remote RENAME command is used to rename a file or set  of  files.
 RENAME is used with two arguments in the format:

                Kermit-11>REMOTE RENAME oldname newname

 If the remote RENAME is used with one or no argument it  will  prompt
 for missing arguments:
                Kermit-11>REMOTE RENAME
                From: oldname
                To:   newname

 When the remote RENAME is finished the remote Kermit server will most
 likely return either a list of files renamed or a count of the number
 of files renamed.  For a Kermit-11 server running remotely you  would
 get a count of the number of files renamed.

                Kermit-11>REMOTE RENAME t.* junk
                Remote ack: 3 files renamed


2 SPACE

 The REMOTE SPACE command sends a generic command to the remote Kermit
 requesting information about the amounts of space available and space
 used on the remote host.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>REMOTE SPACE

 or

                Kermit-11>REMOTE
                Kermit Remote cmd ?SPACE


2 TYPE

 The REMOTE TYPE command is just like the TYPE command but it tells  a
 remote Kermit server to get the file to be typed on your terminal and
 send it over.

                Kermit-11>REMOTE TYPE FUBAR.MAC


2 WHO

 The REMOTE WHO command instructs a remote Kermit  server  to  send  a
 listing  of  who's  logged  into  the system.  This is currently only
 operational for Kermit server running under RSTS/E.  Please note that
 this command may be restricted by the system manager.

                Kermit-11>REMOTE WHO


1 RENAME

 The RENAME command is used to rename a local (only) file.  RENAME can
 be used with two arguments is the format:

                Kermit-11>RENAME oldname newname

 If RENAME is used with one or no argument it will prompt for  missing
 arguments:
                Kermit-11>RENAME
                From: oldname
                To:   newname

 When RENAME is finished it will return a  'report'  of  what  it  has
 done:

                Kermit-11>RENAME t.* junk
                File DB0:[1,8]T.T1 renamed to DB0:[1,8]JUNK.T1
                File DB0:[1,8]T.T renamed to DB0:[1,8]JUNK.T


1 RESTRICTIONS

 Prior to version 2.21, Kermit-11 did not support 8-bit prefixing.
 Prior to version 2.23, Kermit-11 did  not  support  repeat  character
 encoding.
 The PRO/RT11 version of Kermit-11 will request 8-bit prefixing due to
 the  fact  that  the XC handler does not support 8BIT data.  For most
 Kermits this should not be a problem.  The XC handler  always  strips
 bit  7  from  the  character  being  sent, so the PRO/RT11 version of
 Kermit will request prefixing of such.   It  does  so  internally  by
 setting PARITY to SPACE (always clear the high bit, bit seven).
1 RSTS

 Kermit-11 runs on version 7.2 or later of  RSTS/E.   Due  to  options
 present  in  version  8,  binary  file transfers will not be possible
 under version 7.2 of RSTS/E.  This is due to the use of  8  bit  mode
 for  the  terminal link to allow all characters to be passed.  The so
 called '8BIT' termianl setting  was  new  as  of  version  8.0-06  of
 RSTS/E.

 Any RSTS/E system running Kermit-11 will need the sysgen  option  for
 multiple  private  delimiters  in  the terminal driver.  This special
 mode is needed since the 'normal' RSTS/E binary terminal mode  has  a
 'feature'  that  disables binary mode whenever the terminal times out
 on a read.  Since timeouts are essential to  Kermit  error  recovery,
 binary mode can not be used for i/o.

 Certain functions  of  Kermit-11  require  that  the  system  manager
 install  Kermit  with  temporary  priviledges, these commands are the
 SYSTEM, WHO and REMOTE HOST commands.  Kermit-11 does NOT need  these
 to operate correctly.

 Kermit-11 can only be built under RSTS/E version 8.0 or later due  to
 the use of RMS-11 V2.0 and new assembler directives.

1 RSX11M/M+

 Kermit-11 cannot be installed non-checkpointable due to  an  apparent
 RMS-11 bug.  In other words, don't try to install the task '/CKP=NO'.

 To use the CONNECT command effectively, typeahead support  is  needed
 in  the  terminal driver.  For RSX11M+, set the typeahead buffer size
 high, as in SET /TYPEAHEAD=TT22:200.  Also, if your CONNECT  line  is
 TT22:  (as above), use the mcr command SET /SLAVE=TT22:

 Kermit-11 can only be built under RSX11M version  4.1  or  later,  or
 under  RSX11M-Plus version 2.1 or later due to the use of RMS-11 v2.0
 and new assembler directives.

 There is a SET RSX command, see HELP SET RSX for further information.

 As a side issue, please note that the file K11POS.TSK is quite usable
 under  RSX,  the  difference being that K11RSX.TSK has DECnet support
 and RMS-11 overlayed in the task image (besides  which,  due  to  the
 lack  author's systems running RSX may not be up to date) linked into
 it, whereas K11POS has NO DECnet support but IS linked to the  RMS-11
 library  RMSRES  (V2),  thus  K11POS  saves  disk  space  as  well as
 supporting named directories, ala VMS style.

1 RT11

  Kermit-11, as of version 2.20, has been tested  under  RT11  version
 5.0  under the FB and XM monitors using a DZ11 line for the link, and
 also on a PDT-150  using  the  modem  port  for  the  link.   It  has
 additionally  been  run under Micro-11's and the PRO/350 using the XL
 and XC handlers respectively.
  As of Kermit-11 v2.39, RT11 users can use a SET LIN TT:, which  will
 force  Kermit-11  to  use  the  CONSOLE  port  for  all I/O, with the
 restriction that CONSOLE port I/O must request 8bit prefixing for the
 transfer of BINARY data.  Additionally, if the RT11 system lacks both
 MT service and the XL/XC handler, Kermit-11 will use the  console  by
 default.

  Kermit-11 requires .TWAIT  support  as  well  as  multiple  terminal
 support.   The  use  of multiple terminal support allows Kermit-11 to
 use any type of interface sysgened, including  the  DZ11  and  DZV11.
 The  exceptions  for  MT support and/or XC/XL support are noted above
 regarding console only usage.
  It is possible under version 5 of  RT11  to  use  the  XL:   handler
 instead of the multiple terminal support.  The use of the XL:  driver
 will result in much faster file transfer at high  baud  rates.   Note
 that  XL:   must be set up at system startup or at some time later to
 set the proper speed, CSR and vector.  For PRO/RT11 information,  see
 HELP PRO RT11.

  Please note that the device name syntax for terminal  lines  follows
 the  MT  unit  numbers, thus if a SHO TER gave unit 5 for DZ11 line 0
 the the device name would be:

        Kermit-11>SET LINE 5

 If you must use the console port:

        Kermit-11>SET LIN TT:

 If you use the XL handler, you would do this:

        Kermit-11>SET LINE XL:

 Additionally, Kermit-11 for RT11 looks for its help file, K11HLP.HLP,
 on DK:  first and then on SY:  if the first one fails.

 Full wildcarding is supported for RT11, in the form  *.type,  name.*,
 *.* and the % character to match any single character.

 Kermit-11 can only be built on RT11 version 5.0 or later due  to  the
 use of new assembler directives.
 Please note that for the CONNECT command under RT11 and  the  use  of
 the MT service, you will most likely need XON/XOFF flow control to be
 generated by Kermit-11.  This is  enabled  with  the  SET  RTFLOW  ON
 command.   This  is by default OFF since the modem the author uses, a
 Vadic 212LS, can't handle XONs and XOFFs while in command mode.   The
 solution  here  is  to  escape  back to Kermit command mode after the
 remote system has been logged into, and then type SET RTFLOW ON.

 Due to overlaying constraints, the RT11  Kermit-11  will  not  accept
 wildcards  for  the  RENAME and DELETE commands and the REMOTE server
 equivalents.

 The executable files are K11XM.SAV for the XM system and PRO/350, and
 K11RT4 for the FB system.

 For notes regarding hardware, see K11USR.DOC

1 SEND

 The SEND command will allow the user to send a file(s) to  the  other
 Kermit.  If Kermit-11 is running in remote mode the file will be sent
 on the controlling terminal line after waiting the number of  seconds
 specified  by  the  SET  DELAY  command.  This gives the user time to
 escape to the other Kermit and issue a receive command.  If Kermit-11
 is  running  in local mode , the file will be sent immediately on the
 terminal line specified by the SET LINE command.  Format of the  SEND
 command is:

                Kermit-11>SEND file-specification

 Where 'file-specification' can include device, PPN, or UIC,  as  well
 as the file-spec.  which may use wildcarding.

1 SERVER

 The SERVER  command  will  put  Kermit-11  into  server  mode.   When
 Kermit-11  is  in  server  mode  while  running  as  a  remote Kermit
 (transmitting over the controlling terminal line)  the  other  Kermit
 can issue server commands to send and receive files without having to
 give SEND or RECEIVE commands to Kermit-11.  In  order  to  correctly
 receive  binary files while in server mode a SET FILETYPE BINARY must
 be done first.  At this  time  there  is  no  way  for  Kermit-11  to
 determine  whether  an  incomming  file  is ASCII or binary.  Command
 format is:

                Kermit-11>SERVER


  At this time, the Kermit-11 server can process the following
  commands:

                BYE             Logout Kermit-11.
                REMOTE COPY     Copy a file to another.
                REMOTE DIR      Prints a directory out.
                REMOTE DISK     Prints the disk  space.
                REMOTE ERASE    Delete the filename(s).
                FINISH          Exits Kermit-11 server.
                GET             Sends  the filename(s).
                REMOTE HELP     Prints this  help text.
                REMOTE HOST     Execute a host command.
                REMOTE RENAME   Rename old file to new.
                REMOTE SPACE    Prints the disk  space.
                REMOTE TYPE     Prints the filename(s).
                REMOTE WHO      Shows users logged  in.



1 SET

 The SET command is used to set various  parameters  in  Kermit.   The
 format of the SET command is:

                Kermit-11>SET parameter keyword


2 ATTRIBUTES

 Part of the Kermit  protocol  is  the  support  of  file  attributes.
 Connected  Kermits  that  support  this  can send information to each
 other about file size, time/date of creation, RMS  file  headers  and
 other  useful  things.   Due  to potential problems with incompatible
 implementations this feature can be  disabled.   In  this  case,  the
 sending Kermit-11 will never try to send file attributes, even though
 the receiver may have indicated that it supports this.

                Kermit-11>SET ATTRIBUTES OFF
                Kermit-11>SET ATTRIBUTES ON
                Kermit-11>SET NOATTRIBUTES


2 BAUD

 This is the same as SET SPEED.  See HELP SET SPEED

2 BINARY-TYPE

 Kermit-11 has a default list of filetypes that are scanned to  decide
 if  a file should be sent in binary mode in addition to checking file
 attributes for RSX, P/OS and RSTS/E.  The user can, however,  overide
 this  list  with  the  this  command.   The  default  list  is fairly
 inclusive, with types such as .SAV and .TSK  forcing  Kermit-11  into
 binary transmission.  See HELP SET FIL for the default list.

        Kermit-11> SET BINARY-TYPE .SAV
        Kermit-11> SET BIN .EXE


2 BLOCK-CHECK

 The SET BLOCKCHECK command is  used  to  determine  the  block  check
 sequence  which  will  be  used during transmission.  The block check
 sequence is used to detect  transmission  errors.   There  are  three
 types  of  block  check  available.   These  are the single character
 checksum  (default),  the  two  character  checksum,  and  the  three
 character  CRC  (cyclic  redundancy  check).   This  command does not
 ensure that the desired type of block check will be used, since  both
 Kermit's involved in the transfer must agree on the block check type.
 Kermit-11 will request that the type  of  block  check  set  by  this
 command be used for a transfer.  If the other Kermit has also had the
 same block check type requested, then the desired  block  check  type
 will be used.  Otherwise, the single character checksum will be used.
 The command should be given to BOTH Kermits since Kermit-11, when  in
 server  mode, has no say about what kind of checksum it wants to use.
 (See Kermit protocol manual for more information.)

            Kermit-11>SET BLOCK_CHECK keyword
           Kermit-11>SET BLO 1
           Kermit-11>SET BLO 2
           Kermit-11>SET BLO 3

 Where keyword is one of:

          1_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM or ONE_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM

          2_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM or TWO_CHARACTER_CHECKSUM

          3_CHARACTER_CRC_CCITT or THREE_CHARACTER_CRC_CCITT


2 CONSOLE

 The SET CONSOLE command is used under P/OS to control the passing  of
 8  bit  data  to  th terminal during the CONNECT command.  If you are
 getting multinational characters being printed, this is a very useful
 thing to set.  The default is SET CON 7.

        Kermit-11>SET CON 8
        Kermit-11>SET CON 7


2 DEBUG

 The SET DEBUG command is used  to  specify  the  type  and  level  of
 debugging  to a disk file .  This disk file must have been created by
 the SET LOGFILE command.  The format for SET DEBUG is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG qualifier
                Kermit-11>SET NODEBUG


3 ALL

 SET DEBUG ALL will turn on logging for CONSOLE, CONNECT, FILE, PACKET
 and STATE to the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is
 the same as SET DEBUG ON.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG ALL


3 CONSOLE

 SET DEBUG CONSOLE will turn on logging for all I/O  during  a  remote
 CONNECT  to  the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is
 the same as SET DEBUG CONNECT.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG CONSOLE


3 CONNECT

 SET DEBUG CONNECT will turn on logging for all I/O  during  a  remote
 CONNECT  to  the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is
 the same as SET DEBUG CONSOLE.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG CONNECT


3 FILE

 SET DEBUG FILE will log all file 'opens' and 'creates'  to  the  file
 specified by SET LOGFILE.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG FILE


3 HELP

 SET DEBUG HELP gives the user a list of all qualifiers which  can  be
 used with SET DEBUG.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG HELP


3 NONE

 SET DEBUG NONE turns off all debugging.  This is the same as the  SET
 DEBUG OFF command.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG NONE


3 OFF

 SET DEBUG OFF turns off all debugging.  This is the same as  the  SET
 DEBUG NONE command.  Command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG OFF


3 ON

 SET DEBUG ON will turn on logging for CONSOLE, CONNECT, FILE,  PACKET
 and STATE to the disk file specified by SET LOGFILE.  This command is
 the same as SET DEBUG ALL.  The command format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG ON


3 PACKET

 SET DEBUG PACKET will turn on logging of  all  receive  and  transmit
 packets  to  the  disk  file  specified  by SET LOGFILE.  The command
 format is:

                Kermit-11>SET DEBUG PACKET


3 STATE

 SET DEBUG STATE will turn on logging of all internal Kermit-11  state
 transitions

2 DELAY

 The DELAY parameter is the number of seconds to wait  before  sending
 data  after  a SEND command is given.  This is used when Kermit-11 is
 running in remote mode to allow the user time to escape back  to  the
 other Kermit and give a RECEIVE command.

            Kermit-11>SET DELAY number-of-seconds

 Where number of seconds is the (decimal) number  of  second  to  wait
 before sending data.

2 DEFAULT

 The DEFAULT parameter allows you to specify a device and UIC (or PPN)
 for  all  subsequent  file  opens (for SENDING) and file creates (for
 RECEIVING).  It is disabled by typing SET HOME.

                Kermit-11>SET DEFAULT device
                Kermit-11>SET DEFAULT DB2:[200,201]

 This is quite useful for Kermit-11 running on a DECnet link,  as  you
 can  set  the  default  for file operations to include node names and
 passwords as in:

                Kermit-11>set def orion::sys$system:[fubar]


2 DIAL

 The SET DIAL command is used to configure an undefined modem type  to
 enable  the  DIAL  command  to function.  Since the discussion of SET
 DIAL is quite involved, please consult the Kermit-11 User's Guide for
 further   information.   The  following  commands  are  supported  by
 Kermit-11 for the SET DIAL command:

                Kermit-11>SET DIAL WAKEUP string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL WAKE_STRING string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL PROMPT string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL INITIATE string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL FORMAT string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL SUCCESS string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL INFORMATION string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL FAILURE string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL CONFIRM string
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL WAKE_RATE delay
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL DIAL_RATE delay
                Kermit-11>SET DIAL DIAL_PAUSE string


2 DUPLEX

 The DUPLEX parameter controls whether an outgoing link (set  via  the
 SET  LINE  command)  is  a  full  duplex link (the default) or a half
 duplex link.  All it does for half duplex is to cause all  characters
 typed after the CONNECT command to be echoed locally.

                Kermit-11>SET DUPLEX HALF
                Kermit-11>SET DUPLEX FULL


2 END-OF-LINE

 The END-OF-LINE parameter sets the ASCII character which will be used
 as  a line terminator for all packets SENT to the other KERMIT.  This
 is normally not needed for most versions of KERMIT.

                Kermit-11>SET END-OF-LINE octal-value-of-character


2 ESCAPE

 This  command  will  set  the  escape  character  for   the   CONNECT
 processing.   The  command will take the octal value of the character
 to use as the escape character.  This is the character which is  used
 to  "escape"  back  to Kermit-11 after using the CONNECT command.  It
 defaults to control (octal 34).  It is usually a  good  idea  to  set
 this  character  to something which is not used (or at least not used
 very much) on the system being to which Kermit-11 is CONNECTing.

            Kermit-11>SET ESCAPE octal-character-value

 Where octal-character-value is the ASCII value of  the  character  to
 use as the escape character (in octal).

2 FILETYPE

 This command will set the file type that Kermit is receiving.  A file
 type  of  ASCII  should be used to receive text files which are to be
 used as text files on the PDP-11 system.  The file type BINARY should
 be  used  for binary files, such as CP/M .COM files, which need to be
 kept in a format that allows the file  to  be  returned  without  any
 changes.

            Kermit-11>SET FILE_TYPE type
            Kermit-11>SET FIL BIN

3 ASCII

 File type ASCII is for text files.

3 AUTO

 Kermit-11 will normally try to decide if  a  file  must  be  sent  in
 binary  mode  based  on  the  file  attributes and filetype.  If, for
 instance, the directory entry for FUBAR.TXT showed it to be  RMS  (or
 FCS)  fixed  length records, Kermit-11 will switch to binary mode and
 send it verbatim.  If the receiving Kermit  is  Kermit-11,  then  the
 sending  Kermit  will  send  attribute data over also.  The following
 file types also will normally be sent as binary files unless you  use
 the SET FILE NOAUTO command.

                *.TSK   ; rsx, ias, and rsts tasks
                *.SAV   ; rt11 and rsts save images
                *.OBJ   ; compiler and mac output
                *.STB   ; tkband link symbol tables
                *.CRF   ; tkb and link cross reference files
                *.TSD   ; 'time shared dibol' for rt11
                *.BAC   ; rsts basic+ 'compiled' files
                *.OLB   ; rsx, ias, and rsts object libraries
                *.MLB   ; rsx, ias, and rsts macro libraries
                *.RTS   ; rsts/e run time systems
                *.EXE   ; vms executable

3 BINARY

 File type BINARY is for non-text files.  Note that binary files which
 are  generated  on  a  PDP-11 system cannot be transferred to another
 (non PDP-11) system without losing file attributes.  This means  that
 (for  example),  an  RMS-11  indexed  file cannot be transmitted with
 Kermit-11 at this time.  You can not have parity set to anything  but
 NONE  to  use  binary  file transfer (see HELP SET PARITY) unless the
 other  Kermit  can  process  eight  bit  quoting.   Two   Kermit-11's
 connected  to  each  other will use binary transmission automatically
 via the Kermit attribute packets, preserving file attributes where it
 makes sense (ie, RSTS/E and RSX only).

3 FIXED

 SET FIL FIXED is the same as SET FIL BIN

3 NOAUTO

 SET FILE  NOAUTO  disables  Kermit-11  from  trying  to  base  binary
 transmission mode on file attributes or filetype.

3 PROTECT

 See HELP SET FILE SUPERCEDE for information.

3 SUPERCEDE

 SET FILE [NO]SUPERCEDE allows Kermit-11 to  accept  or  reject  files
 received  (from  either  the  RECEIVE  or GET commands) on a per file
 basis.  The default is SUPERCEDE.   By  doing  SET  FILE  NOSUPERCEDE
 Kermit-11  will  always  check  to  see  if the file to be created is
 already there (independent of version number) and reject  it  to  the
 sending  server  if it exists.  This presumes that the Kermit sending
 the file understands the protocol to reject one file of a  (possibly)
 wildcarded group of files.
 The main use of this is to resume getting a group of files, as in GET
 KER:K11*.*  or  GET  KER:MS????.*  having  lost  the connection after
 transfering some of the files.   If  this  is  set,  then  any  files
 already transfered will not be transfered again.

        Kermit-11>SET FILE SUPERCEDE
        Kermit-11>SET FILE NOSUPERCEDE

3 TEXT

 SET FIL TEXT is the same as SET FIL ASCII

3 TYPE

 The SET FILE TYPE xxx command  is  the  same  as  the  SET  FILE  xxx
 command.   The  keyword  TYPE is ignored for compatibility with other
 implementations of Kermit.

2 HANGUP

 SET HANGUP is the same  as  the  DISCONNECT  command.   It  forces  a
 connected  line  (specified  via the SET LINE command) to be dropped.
 This is currently only supported for RSTS version 8.

                Kermit-11>SET HANGUP


2 HOME

 SET HOME resets the default device and UIC (or PPN) to  nothing,  ie,
 all  file  opens and creates use your default disk (SY:) and your UIC
 (or PPN).

                Kermit-11>SET HOME


2 IBM-MODE

 The SET IBM ON (or OFF) will instruct Kermit-11 to wait for an XON
 following each packet sent to an IBM host. Since the default for IBM
 mode may not always be appropiate for your IBM compatible system, you
 can always use the SET HANDSHAKE XON and SET DUPLEX HALF to avoid the
 parity setting implied by using IBM mode.
 .lit

                Kermit-11>SET IBM ON
                Kermit-11>SET IBM OFF


2 LINE

 The SET LINE command sets the terminal  name  up  for  use  with  the
 CONNECT  command.   To  use this you must have access to that device.
 On many systems terminal lines other than your own are protected from
 access, and may require special procedures to access them.
 The form of the device name is  TTnnn:,  where  'nnn'  is  a  decimal
 number  for  RSTS  and  an octal number for RSX11M/M+.  For RT11, the
 device name is simply the  MT  unit  number  shown  by  the  SHO  TER
 command,  as  in  '5'  for  DZ11  unit  0 line 4.  If you are running
 K11POS.TSK for P/OS on the PRO/350, Kermit-11 will set  the  line  to
 XK0:  and the speed to 9600 baud when Kermit starts.  To override the
 line or speed, set HELP SET LINE and HELP SET SPEED.
 As of Kermit-11 v2.39, RT11 users can use a SET LIN TT:,  which  will
 force  Kermit-11  to  use  the  CONSOLE  port  for  all I/O, with the
 restriction that CONSOLE port I/O must request 8bit prefixing for the
 transfer of BINARY data.  Additionally, if the RT11 system lacks both
 MT service and the XL/XC Kermit-11 will use the console by default.

                Kermit-11>SET LINE TT55:        (for RSTS and RSX)
                Kermit-11>SET LINE 5            (for RT11)
                Kermit-11>SET LINE XK0:         (for P/OS)
                Kermit-11>SET LINE XL:          (for RT11)
 See HELP CONNECT, HELP  SET  DUPLEX  and  HELP  SET  SPEED  for  more
 information.

2 LOGFILE

 The SET LOGFILE command creates a debug dump file for you.   It  must
 be  used  BEFORE  any SET DEBUG commands can be used.  See HELP DEBUG
 for further information about debugging modes.

                Kermit-11>SET LOGFILE MYLOG.TXT
                Created debug file MYLOG.TXT
                Kermit-11>


2 MODEM

 The SET MODEM command is used to establish the type of modem you  are
 using  for  the  DIAL command.  If the type of modem is not currently
 supported, the DIAL command will not function.  As of  this  writing,
 27-Jan-85,  the  Racal  Vadic  VA212PA, VA212PAR, generic VA3400 with
 autodialler option, Digital  DF112,  MicroCom  SX1200,  Rixon  R212A,
 PRO/TMS  and  Hayes  modems  are supported.  The older VADIC 3212 and
 34xx modems with autodialing options should  also  function  via  SET
 MODEM  VADIC.   The following modems are defined.  The DF200 and DF03
 types have not been tested.

                Kermit-11>SET MOD VA212PA
                Kermit-11>SET MOD VA212PAR
                Kermit-11>SET MOD VADIC   
                Kermit-11>SET MOD DF03    
                Kermit-11>SET MOD DF100   
                Kermit-11>SET MOD DF200                           
                Kermit-11>SET MOD HAYES                           
                Kermit-11>SET MOD MICROCOM
                Kermit-11>SET MOD R212A   
                Kermit-11>SET MOD PROTMS                          


 An implcit SET MOD PROTMS is done if the line is XTn:  and the  modem
 type is undefined under P/OS on the PRO/350.

2 PACKET-LENGTH

 You can alter the default transmitted  packet  length  with  the  SET
 PACKET-LENGTH command.  This should not normally be needed unless the
 line is very noisy, at which time you should probably give up anyway.

                Kermit-11>SET PACKET 60


2 PARITY

 This is used with the SET LINE and CONNECT commands  to  specify  the
 type  of  parity for the remote link.  It defaults to NONE and can be
 either ODD, EVEN, MARK or SPACE as in:

                Kermit-11>SET PARITY NONE
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY ODD
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY EVEN
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY MARK
                Kermit-11>SET PARITY SPACE

 All parity generation is done via software, no  special  hardware  is
 used.   The  use of software parity generation is restricted to 8 bit
 links only.  The character format, if parity is set to  anything  but
 NONE, will be 7 bits of data followed with high bit set or cleared to
 indicate the parity.  If you set parity to  anything  but  NONE  (the
 default) you can NOT, at this time, send binary files.  Attempting to
 set parity if the FILETYPE is BINARY will result  in  an  error  (SET
 FILETYPE qualifier).

2 PAUSE

 PAUSE tells Kermit to wait the specified number  of  seconds  between
 each packet being sent to the other Kermit.  This may be useful under
 situations of heavy system load.  This may be automatically  computer
 by Kermit-11 in a future release as a function of line speed.

                Kermit-11>SET PAUSE 1


2 PHONE

 Currently, the SET PHONE command supports the NUMBER option, as in:

                Kermit-11>SET PHONE NUMBER WORK 5374411

 This allows Kermit to associate a tag name with a  phone  number  for
 the DIAL command; in the above example:

                Kermit-11>SET MOD VADIC
                Kermit-11>DIAL WORK

 This would cause Kermit-11 to translate WORK to 5374411 and dial  it.
 See the Kermit-11 User's Guide for further information.

2 PROMPT

 The SET PROMPT command is useful if you are using two Kermit-11's  to
 talk  to each other.  By using the SET PROMPT command, you can change
 the prompt from 'Kermit-11>' on either (or both) Kermit to  something
 that would indicate which system you are currently connected to.

                Kermit-11>SET PROMPT KERMIT-11/1170>
                Kermit-11>SET PROMPT FUBAR>
                Kermit-11>SET PROMPT PROKERMIIT-11>


2 RANDOM

 This command allows Kermit-11 to randomly  generate  checksum  errors
 for  testing  error  recovery  of  an  attatched  Kermit.   You would
 normally never use this command.  Another command that goes  with  it
 is  called  SET  SEED  value  which  starts  the pseudo-random number
 generator at a different point.

                Kermit-11>SET RANDOM ON
                Kermit-11>SET RANDOM OFF


2 RECEIVE

 Currently the SET RECEIVE and SET SEND basically  work  the  same  in
 that   they   only   alter   the   END-OF-LINE   character   and  the
 START-OF-PACKET value, as in:

                Kermit-11>SET REC START 2
                Kermit-11>SET REC END 12

3 END-OF-LINE

 This instructs Kermit-11 to expect something other than  the  default
 carriage  return  (octal  15) at the end of a packet.  Kermit-11 will
 ignore packet terminators.  The SET SEND END command is of  more  use
 in conditioning outgoing packets.

3 START-OF-PACKET

 The normal Kermit  packet  prefix  is  Control-A  (1);  this  command
 changes  the  prefix Kermit-11 expects on incoming packets.  The only
 reasons this  should  ever  be  changed  would  be:   Some  piece  of
 equipment  somewhere  between  the  two Kermit programs will not pass
 through a Control-A; or, some piece of of equipment similarly  placed
 is  echoing  its input.  In the latter case, the recipient of such an
 echo can  change  the  packet  prefix  for  outbound  packets  to  be
 different  from  that  of arriving packets so that the echoed packets
 will be ignored.  The opposite Kermit must also be told to change the
 prefix  for  its  inbound  packets and the prefix it uses on outgoing
 packets.

                Kermit-11>SET REC START-OF-PACKET 2


3 PACKET-LENGTH

 SET RECEIVE PACKET-LENGTH

 This command has two functions.  The first, and  normal  one,  is  to
 reduce  incoming packet lengths in the event that normal sized Kermit
 packets can not be passed through the communications circuit.   There
 could  be, perhaps, some 'black box' somewhere in the link that has a
 very small buffer size; this command could be used to reduce the size
 that the SENDING Kermit will use.

 The other use is to enable a new protocol extension to Kermit  called
 'LONG  PACKETS'.   The actual protocol is documented elsewhere, let's
 just say that this is a way for two Kermit's to use packet sizes  far
 greater  than  the normal ('Classic') packet size of 90 characters or
 so.  The main use of this feature is in file transfer over links that
 introduce considerable delay, it is not uncommon for packets to incur
 an one to two second delay.  The net result is a  VERY  slow  running
 Kermit with an effective speed of perhaps 300 to 600 baud rather than
 1200 or 2400 baud.  By  making  the  packets  longer,  we  raise  the
 effective  speed  of  such  a  circuit.   The main restriction on the
 packet size chosen is the link, a given  circuit  may  not  pass  500
 character packets.  Also, BOTH Kermits must support this extension to
 the protocol, they will always negotiate it before any file transfer.
 See the notes at the end of this document for more information.

                Kermit-11>SET REC PAC 50
                Kermit-11>SET REC PAC 600

 It is HIGHLY recommended that you use the CRC  block  check,  as  the
 default  type one checksum could be inadequate for such long packets,
 as in:

                Kermit-11>SET BLO 3


2 POS (P/OS on the PRO/350)

 The currently available options on the SET command  for  the  PRO/3x0
 under P/OS version 2 are:

        Kermit-11>SET POS DTE
        Kermit-11>SET POS NODTE

 The DTE option tells Kermit-11 to attempt to spawn PRO/Communications
 (DTE)  as  the  CONNECT  code; this allows the use of the 'grey keys'
 SETUP to set terminal emulation characteristics, and the use  of  the
 'EXIT'  key  to  return to the Kermit-11 command level.  The 'SET POS
 DTE' command enables the attempt to call PRO/COMM, whereas  the  'SET
 POS NODTE' enables the builtin terminal emulation.

2 RECORD-FORMAT

 Kermit will,  by  default,  create  RMS-11  variable  length  implied
 carriage  control  records for text files.  You can override this and
 change it to create stream ascii records with the  SET  RECORD-FORMAT
 STREAM  command.   This is useful for RSTS/E systems if you need file
 compatibility with BASIC-Plus.

                Kermit-11>SET RECORD-FORMAT STREAM
                Kermit-11>SET RECORD-FORMAT VARIABLE

 This command would be most useful in  a  KERMIT.INI  file,  which  is
 executed by KERMIT when Kermit starts.

2 RETRY

 SET RETRY value tells Kermit to try  that  many  times  on  a  NAK'ed
 packet  before  giving up.  This should only be needed if the line is
 extremely noisy or the PDP-11 host is running very slowly due to  the
 system load.

                Kermit-11>SET RETRY 10


2 RSX

 The SET RSX command is intended to deal with  the  peculiarities  oft
 found  with RSX systems.  There are currently three SET RSX commands,
 as in:

        Kermit-11>SET RSX FASTIO        Default for packet reading,
                                        waits for <CR>.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX CHARIO        Read one char at a time for
                                        packet reading.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX TC.DLU n      Alters  the TC.DLU setting.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX CONNECT ALT   Uses a new  (v2.33) CONNECT
                                        driver which bypasses TTDRV
                                        flow control.
        Kermit-11>SET RSX CONNECT DEF   Use old CONNECT code (2.32)

2 RT11

3 CREATE-SIZE

 The SET RT11 CREATE value command was  added  to  assist  those  RT11
 users  with  very  small  disks  to  be  able to get files with sizes
 greater that half of the availble contiguous space  availble.   While
 this  is  NOT a problem going from one Kermit-11 to another Kermit-11
 since the PDP-11 Kermit supports a subset of the  protocol  known  as
 'ATTRIBUTES',  other  Kermits  may  not  support the exchange of file
 sizes (most do not).  Thus if your largest contiguous  space  is  300
 blocks and you want to get a 250 block file, the command:

        Kermit-11>SET RT11 CRE 250

 would be needed, as RT11 by default only allocates 50 percent of  the
 available space.

3 FLOW-CONTROL

 Note that for the CONNECT command under RT11  you  will  most  likely
 need  XON/XOFF  flow  control  to be generated by Kermit-11.  This is
 enabled with the SET RT11 FLOW command.  This is  by  default  NOFLOW
 since the modem the author uses, a Vadic 212LS, can't handle XONs and
 XOFFs while in command mode.  The solution here is to escape back  to
 Kermit command mode after the remote system has been logged into, and
 then type SET RT11 FLOW.
 The effect of SET RT11 FLOW is for Kermit-11, when in  CONNECT  mode,
 to send an XOFF to the host every eight characters.  When the loop in
 the CONNECT module finds no more data in the input buffer,  it  sends
 up  to  2 XON characters (in case the first XON got lost) to tell the
 remote system to start sending again.  The reason  for  doing  so  is
 that  the  RT11 multiple terminal service is very slow about handling
 input interupts and does not do any of it's  own  flow  control  when
 it's  internal  ring  buffer gets full.  This has been tested at line
 speeds up to 4800 baud without losing data.  This setting should  not
 be needed for use with the XC/XL handlers.
 SET RT11 FLOW has NO effect on packet transmission, since the  Kermit
 packet  size  is  never  mode  than 96 characters, and the RT11 input
 buffer is 134 chararcters in size.

                Kermit-11>SET RT11 FLOW
                Kermit-11>SET RT11 NOFLOW


3 VOLUME-VERIFY

 Normally RT11 Kermit-11 will check the directory header of a disk  to
 verify  that  it  most  likely  contains  a valid RT11 file structure
 before trying to read the directory.  If for some  reason  your  disk
 does  not  contain  the  standard  data  at offset 760 in the header,
 Kermit-11 will reject the disk.  The  SET  RT11  NOVOL  command  will
 instruct Kermit-11 to bypass that check.

                Kermit-11>SET RT11 VOL
                Kermit-11>SET RT11 NOVOL


2 SEND

 The SET SEND command  controls  what  Kermit-11  will  be  doing  for
 outgoing  packets in that you may want to alter the packet terminator
 and/or the start of packet character (by  default,  15  octal  and  1
 octal respectively.  See HELP SET RECEIVE for more information.

2 SPEED

 SET SPEED value sets the line speed for the device specified via  the
 SET  LINE  command,  and  used for the CONNECT command.  Changing the
 speed of a terminal line requires privilege for RSTS  and  RSX11M/M+.
 The  SET SPEED command will only function with a DH11, DHV11, DZ11 or
 DZV11 multiline interface.

                Kermit-11>SET SPEED 1200

 1200 Baud would be a normal speed to use with a VA212LS or a DF03.

 Please note that Kermit-11 CANNOT change the speed  of  a  DL11  type
 interface,  nor can it change the speed of a PDT-150 modem port.  For
 a PDT-150 modem port, use a command  of  /M/S:nnnn.   to  change  the
 speed to nnnn for the SPEED.SAV program.

2 START-OF-PACKET

 The SET START octal-value tells Kermit-11 to expect and also to  send
 as  the  start of packet character the specified character instead of
 the default Control-A  (octal  1).   Note  that  both  Kermit's  must
 support  this  command (or SET RECEIVE/SEND START value) as it is not
 possible for two Kermit's to negociate this.  This set command is the
 same as doing both a SET REC START n and SET SEND START n.

                Kermit-11>SET START 2
                Kermit-11>SET START 1


2 TIMEOUT

 The timeout value tells Kermit how long to wait to get a packet  from
 the  other  Kermit.  If system loads are high, it may be desirable to
 increase this beyond the default of 10 seconds.

2 TERMINAL

 The SET TERMINAL command simply  controls  the  way  which  Kermit-11
 prints  packet  counts  while  send  or receiving a file (or group of
 files).  The simplest way is the default, SET TER TTY.  Using SET TER
 VT100  will  cause Kermit to display headers for the numbers printed,
 at a possible cost in packet speed due to screen control overhead.

                Kermit-11>SET TER TTY
                Kermit-11>SET TER VT100


2 UPDATE

 The SET UPDATE command controls the frequency  at  which  the  packet
 count  display is updated.  The default is 1, displaying each packet.
 A SET UPD 0 will disable all packet count logs, whereas a SET  UPD  N
 will update the display every N packets.  The SET NOUPDATE command is
 the same as SET UPDATE 0.

1 SHOW

 The SHOW command will display the settings made by  the  SET  command
 and allow you to look at session statistics.

                Kermit-11>SHOW parameter

2 ALL
 Displays everything:   BLOCK-CHECK     DEBUG           DEFAULT         ESCAPE
                        FILE-TYPE       LINE            PACKET          PARAM
                        TIME            VERSION

2 BLOCK-CHECK-TYPE

 Displays the current type of checksum set.

2 DEBUG

 Shows the status of debugging.

2 DEFAULT

 Shows the device and UIC (or PPN) used for file operations.

2 ESCAPE

 Shows the escape character used to return to a local Kermit-11

2 FILE-TYPE

 Shows the current filetype (BINARY or ASCII)

2 LINE

 Displays parameters associated with the current CONNECT line.

2 PACKET

 Prints out packets statistics from the last transaction and total  so
 far.

2 PARAMETERS

 Prints out various send parameters
2 RECORD-FORMAT

 Shows what kind of file will be created by Kermit.

2 TIME

 The time of day

2 VERSION

 My current version and edit.

1 STARTUP

 You can place a file called  KERMIT.INI  in  your  account  and  have
 Kermit-11 automatically read commands from it before getting commands
 from your terminal.

1 SYSTEM

 The SYSTEM command takes a CCL/MCR/DCL command line and spawns a task
 to  execute it.  This is done via the SPWN$S directive for RSX and by
 spawning a job on a pseudo-keyboard for RSTS.  If the  command  fails
 for  RSTS  then  Kermits  protection  code  was  set  to  run without
 privileges.

                Kermit-11>SYS PIP DB1:=FUBAR.DAT
                Kermit-11>SYS
                Command: SUB MYJOB
                Kermit-11>


1 TAKE

 The Take command is just like the @ command.  It opens  a  disk  file
 for reading commands from, as in TAKE filename.

                Kermit-11>TAKE MYKERM.CMD


1 TSX+

 Kermit-11 for TSX+ is exactly the same  Kermit  used  under  RT11/XM.
 Kermit-11  for RT11 always checks for the type of system it is on, be
 that RT11, PRO/RT11 or TSX+.  At run time, it will  dispatch  to  the
 correct overlay for doing terminal I/O (or XL/XC I/O).  Note that for
 TSX+, you can only dial out by using the XL  handler,  supplied  with
 version 5.  As far as system requirements go the author has been told
 that the sysgen parameter DINSPC in TSGEN.MAC mu st at least 100 (10)
 in  value, otherwise the terminal driver will be unable to buffer the
 entire received Kermit packet.  Since the author does not have or use
 TSX+,  any  problems  that arise on TSX+ will have to be fixed by the
 site's systems personel and reported back to the author.
 To use the CL:   handler  under  TSX+,  the  following  commands  are
 needed.  Please note that 'n' stands for a value, be it a unit number
 or a speed value.  In all  cases,  the  commands  are  KMON  commands
 unless shown with a Kermit-11> prefix.

        .SET CL LINE=n
        .SET CL NOLFOUT
        .SET CL SPEED=nnnn
        .ASS CLn XL
        .run kermit
        Kermit-11>SET LIN XL

 See HELP RT11 for more information that would also pertain to TSX+.

1 TYPE

 The TYPE command prints a file to your terminal, as in:

                Kermit-11>TYPE KERMIT.INI


1 USAGE

 Kermit-11 is normally run on the PDP-11  host  system  as  a  server.
 This means that a remote Kermit can send it commands without the user
 having to be switching between the local Kermit (usually a micro) and
 the  remote Kermit (the one on the PDP-11).  While Kermit-11 supports
 most of the server commands shown in version Four revision 1  of  the
 protocol  manual  (see  HELP REMOTE), not all micro based Kermits are
 able to send these commands to Kermit-11.  Most  Kermits  do  support
 the  GET,  SEND, BYE and FINISH server commands, which are sufficient
 for most file transfers.  The following is an example of  the  dialog
 when  a  DEC  VT180  Robin connects to a PDP-11/70 RSTS system to use
 Kermit.

    A>b:
    B>a:cpmrob
    Kermit-80 V3.6 [VT180 "Robin"]

    Kermit-80  B:>connect
    [Connected to remote host, type Control-\C to return]
